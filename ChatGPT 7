3. Repz Supplements

# REPZ Supplements & PEDs System

## Overview
This module organizes the tracking, visualization, and planning of supplements and performance-enhancing drugs (PEDs) for fitness optimization.

## Key Functional Areas

### Compound Library
- **Classes:** Fat loss, GH secretagogues, anabolics, health/longevity, recovery
- **Entries:** Name, category, delivery (oral/injectable), typical dose range, min/max IU or mg, duration, notes
- **Data fields:**
  - Recommended dosage (typical, minimum)
  - Route (IM, SC, oral)
  - Unit (mg, IU, mL)
  - Mechanism of action
  - Risks/benefits matrix
  - Cycle length guidance

### User Protocol Tracking
- Stack builder: add compounds, group into stacks (e.g., cutting phase)
- Cycle periodization: define blocks (blast, cruise, off, TRT)
- Visual timeline: calendar of dosages, injections, orals
- Reminders: optional app notifications (with timing)

### Health Overlay
- Integrates health tracking (e.g., BP, HRV) to flag adverse events
- Allows noting side effects or subjective experiences (e.g., insomnia, aggression, acne)

### Smart Features
- Suggest “health counterbalance stack” (e.g., NAC, TUDCA, fish oil for liver/cardiovascular)
- Warnings when stacking compounds with overlapping toxicities (e.g., methylated orals)
- Auto-detect cycle transitions (start/end) based on protocol changes

### Example Compound Table Format
| Compound      | Class           | Route | Typical Dose | Max Dose | Cycle Length | Notes                       |
|---------------|------------------|-------|---------------|----------|---------------|----------------------------|
| BPC-157       | Healing Peptide | SC    | 200 mcg/day   | 500 mcg  | 2–4 weeks     | Great for joint recovery   |
| IGF-1 LR3     | Anabolic Peptide| IM/SC | 20–40 mcg/day | 80 mcg   | 4–6 weeks     | Strong growth factor       |
| Retatrutide   | Fat Loss        | SC    | 0.5–2 mg/wk   | 4 mg     | 4–12+ weeks   | GLP/GIP triple agonist     |

## Backend Representation
```ts
interface PEDLog {
  compoundId: string;
  userId: string;
  date: string;
  dose: number;
  route: 'oral' | 'SC' | 'IM';
  notes?: string;
  healthEffects?: string[];
}
```

## Future Features
- PDF export of cycles for coaching or medical review

4. Rep Coaching 

# REPZ Coaching Logic

## Coaching Philosophy
REPZ empowers users to self-coach or receive hybrid coaching using science-backed periodization, metrics-based adaptation, and progressive tracking.

## Coaching Modes
- **Self-Coaching:** Autonomous mode, powered by built-in progress logic
- **Coach-Client:** Shared access, coach creates and reviews plans, comments on check-ins
- **Hybrid:** User logs everything, external coach reviews analytics

## Weekly Cycle
- Day 0: Check-in (summary of logs, adherence, progress)
- Days 1–6: Execute training, PEDs, nutrition, recovery
- Day 7: Reflect, adjust plan (manually or via auto-suggestion)

## Adaptive Intelligence
- Flags plateaus: no PR in 3 weeks → prompts deload or tweak
- Adjusts cardio or PEDs based on weight trends or recovery markers
- Detects underlogging or missing data (e.g., no sleep logs for 3+ days)

## Compliance Engine
- Calculates:
  - Training compliance %
  - Cardio compliance %
  - PED/supplement protocol adherence
  - Sleep tracking adherence
- Displays as badges or weekly summary

## Feedback Loop
- Every check-in includes:
  - Stats summary
  - Mood, energy, soreness notes
  - Graphs of weight trend, calories/macros, step count
- Coaches (or AI) respond with:
  - Macro or PED adjustment suggestions
  - Training split change recommendations

## Periodization Options
- Linear
- Undulating
- Block (strength → hypertrophy → pump)
- Auto-regulated (RIR-based)

## Goal Targeting
- Focused goal modes:
  - Fat loss (integrated cardio and PED emphasis)
  - Muscle gain (volume-centric programming, PED emphasis)
  - Recomp (dynamic adjustment weekly)
  - Contest prep (visual logs, dry-out tracking)

## Coach Inbox (Planned)
- View all active clients’ summaries
- Respond to flagged issues (injury, weight stall, PED interaction)
- Quick reply system (emoji + canned message templates)

## Export/Reports
- Coach can export PDF of cycle history
- Includes: protocols, progress photos, adherence, biometrics

This module ensures REPZ can be used by serious athletes, bodybuilders, and recreational users aiming for measurable progress and smart adjustments.
