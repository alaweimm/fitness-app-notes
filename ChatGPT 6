REPZ Rebrand & Codebase Consolidation Kickoff Package


REPZ’s new brand identity emphasizes data-driven strength training, using a bold orange (#FF5500) and black color scheme. The visual motif (as seen in the logo’s bar icon) is inspired by an activity meter, reflecting intensity and progress.
Project Kickoff Document (Internal)
Objectives and Scope
Unified Codebase: Consolidate multiple repositories into three core repos – repz-app, repz-data, and repz-docs – to streamline development. This means merging front-end apps, backend services, and documentation projects respectively, under the new REPZ brand umbrella.
Rebrand Rollout: Implement the new REPZ branding across all products. Update logos, color schemes (orange #FF5500 and black), and naming in the UI, documentation, and code (class names, package names, etc.). The platform’s look and messaging will align with “data-driven strength training” values, enhancing consistency in user experience.
Maintain and Improve Quality: Use this migration to address legacy tech debt and improve code quality. Standardize on modern tools (monorepo build system, testing frameworks) and ensure the consolidated codebase is well-structured for easier maintenance and future growth.
Timeline Awareness: Complete the consolidation and rebrand within 12 weeks. We will break this period into phased milestones (planning, execution, testing, launch) to track progress and ensure on-time delivery.
Key Benefits
Better Maintainability & Refactoring: A unified repo structure reduces duplication and simplifies code changes. Developers can fix or refactor features across modules in one go, without coordinating changes across multiple repos​

. For example, updating a shared API or UI component can be done once and applied everywhere, improving efficiency. This also means less repository overhead (fewer dependency mismatches and duplicated configs).
Consistency & Code Sharing: Consolidation promotes consistent coding practices and UI/UX. Shared models, utilities, and design components will live in one place, ensuring all parts of the app use the same logic and styles. Teams can more easily share code (e.g. a single design system library for UI elements) rather than maintaining parallel versions in different repos​

. Consistent tooling and linting rules can be applied across the board, enforcing standards in every part of the platform​
circleci.com
.
Improved Collaboration: With all relevant code in a few repos, the visibility of work across the team increases. It becomes easier to understand how different pieces (app, data, docs) interact. Developers can see each other’s changes and coordinate on cross-cutting features without siloed workflows​
enlear.academy
. Code reviews and end-to-end testing are simplified when front-end and back-end changes can be reviewed together in one place, leading to a more tightly integrated development process.
Performance & User Experience: The new structure may yield performance benefits in development and deployment. For instance, coordinated releases from a single pipeline (for app and data services together) can reduce integration issues and ensure optimized interactions between front-end and back-end. Users will experience a more seamless product: the rebrand will present a modernized UI with consistent visuals, and unified code can enable faster feature iterations and fixes, enhancing overall user experience.
Challenges and Constraints
Tight Timeline: 12 weeks is an aggressive timeline for migrating code and rolling out a rebrand. This constraint means we must clearly prioritize critical tasks and possibly defer non-essential enhancements. Staying on schedule will require disciplined scope management and frequent check-ins on progress.
Distributed Team Coordination: Our 7-person team is spread across locations/time zones, which can pose communication challenges. We must account for asynchronous collaboration, ensure clear hand-offs, and use our tools (Slack, GitHub, Notion) effectively to keep everyone aligned despite limited overlap hours. Regular communication practices (detailed in the Communication Plan) will mitigate this.
Legacy Tech Debt: Portions of the existing codebases may be outdated or lack proper test coverage. Unifying them could surface inconsistencies (e.g., different coding styles, duplicate code solving the same problem, or old dependencies). We need to refactor or even rewrite some parts during migration, which is extra work. There’s also a risk of carrying over known bugs if we don’t address them now.
Integration Complexity: Combining repositories means merging build systems, dependency versions, and possibly infrastructure (CI/CD pipelines, hosting setups). We’ll need to reconcile differences like package names, environment configurations, and third-party integrations so that the new repos build and run smoothly. Ensuring that repz-app and repz-data communicate as before (e.g., API endpoints, database connections) is critical. Any mismatch could cause runtime errors after consolidation.
Preserving History and Traceability: A challenge in migrating repositories is preserving commit history for context. Simply copying code into a new repo would result in one big commit, losing blame/ history. We should consider techniques (like git subtree merges) to retain version history of each migrated module​
medium.com
 so that we don’t lose important historical information (who wrote what, why changes were made) during the move.
Parallel Development & Freeze: While migration is ongoing, new feature development in old repos might need to pause or be minimized to avoid divergence. We may institute a "feature freeze" on the old code during the final phase of migration. Coordinating this freeze and communicating it to stakeholders is a known constraint – everyone must be aware that only critical fixes go into old repos while we finish the transition.

Summary for Strategic Partners (External)
Our engineering team is embarking on a 12-week project to rebrand and unify the codebase for our fitness platform under the new REPZ identity. This effort will merge our previously separate applications and services into a streamlined set of repositories and roll out a refreshed user experience. The goals of this initiative are to increase development agility, ensure a consistent user experience, and position REPZ for future growth as a data-driven strength training platform. By consolidating our code, we expect to improve maintainability and performance: updates will roll out faster and more consistently to all parts of the product. Users will notice a cohesive look and feel – featuring REPZ’s signature orange-and-black, activity-meter-inspired design – across the app and documentation. Internally, our team will be able to collaborate more efficiently, reducing duplication and accelerating feature development. We acknowledge that such a migration is a complex undertaking, but we have a clear plan with phased milestones to mitigate risks. Our 7-person distributed team will be coordinated through well-defined communication channels and testing protocols to ensure a smooth transition. For our partners, this rebrand and consolidation will enhance the platform’s stability and extensibility. It lays the foundation for new features and integrations (e.g., advanced analytics, partner APIs) to be added more easily in the future. We are committed to completing this migration with minimal disruption to users, and we will keep our stakeholders updated on key progress points. (This summary is intended for external stakeholders, highlighting the high-level vision and benefits of the REPZ migration without internal technical details.)
Communication Plan (Internal)
Team Overview: We have a 7-person distributed team (mix of front-end, back-end, QA, and design roles). Given our size, each member will wear multiple hats at times. To ensure clarity: one team member will act as Project Lead (coordinating tasks and timeline), another as Dev Lead/Architect (overseeing technical consistency), and others will have clear ownership areas (e.g., one engineer spearheads the repz-app migration, another focuses on repz-data, a designer/UX specialist handles branding consistency, etc.). We will document these roles and responsibilities on Notion so everyone knows who owns which workstream. Communication Channels & Tools: We’ll leverage three primary tools for collaboration:
GitHub Projects – for task tracking and source control integration. All migration tasks and user stories will be logged as issues or cards in a GitHub Project board (one board could cover all three repos, organized by columns for each phase or by repo). This ensures our code discussions (via PRs and issues) link directly to tasks. The Project board will reflect real-time progress, as cards move from “Todo” to “In Progress” to “Done”. We will also use GitHub’s issue tagging to indicate priorities or blockers.
Slack – for daily communication and quick discussions. We’ll have a dedicated channel (e.g., #repz-migration) where the team can post daily updates, ask questions, and flag impediments. Because of time zone differences, we’ll adopt asynchronous stand-ups: each member posts their update every day in Slack (what they did, plan for today, blockers) by a certain cutoff time. The Project Lead will review these and follow up on any blockers or coordinate help as needed. Urgent issues or production alerts will also be surfaced in Slack (with integrations from CI/CD if a build/test fails).
Notion – for documentation and high-level planning. Notion will serve as our internal wiki for this project: hosting the detailed project plan, meeting notes, decision logs, and the Migration Dashboard. The Migration Dashboard (a Notion page) will provide a one-stop overview: project status summary, key dates (timeline), risk log, and links to relevant resources (design specs, testing results, etc.). It will also embed or link to the GitHub Project board for convenience.
Meeting Cadence: To complement asynchronous communication, we’ll institute a regular meeting schedule:
Weekly Planning/Check-in (1 hour) – Once a week, preferably early in the week, the whole team meets via video call. Agenda: review last week’s accomplishments vs. plan, resolve any cross-team issues, and plan the current week’s tasks in detail. This keeps the team synchronized and allows re-prioritization if needed.
Twice-Weekly Stand-up (15-30 min) – In addition to daily Slack check-ins, we’ll have two short live stand-up calls per week (e.g., Tuesday and Thursday) for those who can join. This is to quickly sync on any pressing coordination issues and hear voices – useful given the distribution.
Ad-hoc Pairing/Working Sessions – Team members are encouraged to set up ad-hoc calls or screen-sharing sessions to pair program, especially when dealing with tricky integration problems or code reviews that benefit from real-time discussion. For example, the repz-app lead might pair with the designer to implement the new theme consistently, or back-end and front-end devs might pair to ensure API changes during consolidation don’t break anything.
Stakeholder Updates (bi-weekly) – Every two weeks, the Project Lead will compile a brief update for leadership/strategic partners (this can be done via an email or a Notion page that external stakeholders have access to). This update will include progress against milestones, any new risks or issues, and confirmation of whether we remain on schedule. This ensures visibility and trust with higher-ups or other departments (like marketing, who will want to know when the rebrand goes live).
Roles & Responsibilities: (Summary table for clarity)

Role/Person	Responsibilities
Project Lead (e.g., Alice)	- Overall coordination and timeline management.
- Ensures cross-team blockers are resolved quickly.
- Primary liaison for stakeholder updates.
Dev Lead/Architect (e.g., Bob)	- Technical decision making (repo structure, tooling choices).
- Code review for critical merges to ensure quality and consistency.
- Guides refactoring to address tech debt.
Front-end Dev(s)	- Migrate and refactor repz-app code.
- Implement UI rebranding (colors, logo, UX improvements).
- Ensure front-end tests (unit/E2E) cover the new changes.
Back-end Dev(s)	- Migrate and refactor repz-data services.
- Rewire any service integrations, config, or database links for new setup.
- Add tests for data integrity and service endpoints.
Docs/Content Dev (or Tech Writer)	- Consolidate repz-docs content (user guides, API docs).
- Update screenshots, terminology, and branding in documentation.
- Work with others to document new repo setup for devs.
Designer/UX	- Provide updated style guidelines (fonts, color usage, logo placements).
- Review the app post-migration to ensure brand consistency and improved UX.
- Assist in creating any new graphics or UI components needed for REPZ branding.
QA Engineer	- Develop and run test plans on the new consolidated application.
- Set up automated test suites (with devs) in CI for regression prevention.
- Verify that all critical user journeys work on the staging environment before launch.
(Note: Some team members may fill multiple roles – e.g., a front-end dev might also cover the Docs work, or the Dev Lead might double as back-end dev – the table is about roles, which can overlap.) Update Workflows: We will enforce a workflow that keeps everyone informed:
All code changes go through Pull Requests (PRs) on GitHub. Each PR template will have a section to indicate if the change affects multiple areas (so others can review if needed). We’ll require at least one other dev’s approval for every PR, and the Dev Lead’s approval for core architectural changes.
When a PR is merged, an automatic notification will post in Slack (via GitHub integration) so everyone is aware of new changes in the main branch. This helps catch if something might affect their work.
The Project board will be kept up-to-date: when someone starts a task, they assign themselves and move the card to “In Progress”. When done (and merged), it goes to “Done” with a link to the PR. This way, anyone can see the status of migration tasks at a glance.
Notion Dashboard Structure: Our Notion project dashboard will include:
A Progress Overview section – a checklist or progress bar indicating overall percent completion (e.g., X of Y tasks done, or milestones completed).
Milestones Timeline – a simplified view of the 12-week timeline, highlighting which phase we are in. We could use a Notion timeline view or simply list weeks with their goals (mirroring the table above).
Key Links – links to the GitHub Project board, latest build status (perhaps via a CI badge), and important documents (like this kickoff doc, testing strategy doc, etc.).
Risk Log – a table listing identified risks, owner, status of mitigation actions (updated regularly, see Risk section below).
Team Contacts – list of team members with roles and best contact methods (useful for quick reference, especially if new stakeholders join or someone needs to find who to ask about X).
Optionally, an embedded Slack summary or integration (Notion can embed some Slack or we can manually update a “Updates” section with recent highlights).
This Notion dashboard will be the default landing page for anyone (team or stakeholder) wanting to check on the project’s status without digging through GitHub. It will be updated by the Project Lead at least twice a week (after the major check-in meetings).
By combining these communication practices, we aim to keep the entire team coordinated, informed, and able to react quickly to issues. The emphasis is on transparency (everyone can see what’s going on via the project board and dashboard) and regular touchpoints to prevent any team member or task from slipping through the cracks.
Tools and Approaches
Monorepo Strategy and Code Migration
To effectively consolidate code, we will adopt a monorepo or unified repository approach for each of the three new repos. For the application code (likely JavaScript/TypeScript for front-end, and possibly Node.js for back-end), modern monorepo tools will greatly assist in managing the combined projects. We are considering Nx and Turborepo as primary options to streamline this cross-repo migration:
Nx (Nrwl Extensions): Nx is a battle-tested monorepo framework offering an integrated approach with advanced tooling (built-in support for multiple frameworks, testing, linting, etc.). It provides features like an affected graph (to run tasks only on changed parts of the codebase) and excellent support for large-scale projects. Nx’s comprehensive approach means a slightly higher learning curve, but it’s very powerful for ensuring everything in repz-app stays organized. For example, Nx can enforce module boundaries (preventing unintended dependencies between, say, mobile app code and web app code if both live in repz-app), and it has plugins for common tech (React, Angular, Node, etc.). Nx also offers great performance and caching for builds; in large monorepos it’s shown >7x speed improvements in certain cases​
nx.dev
. It’s a full-featured solution, which aligns with our need for reliability in this migration​
wisp.blog
.
Turborepo: Turborepo is a newer, lightweight monorepo tool (now backed by Vercel) focusing on ultra-fast task running and caching. It’s simpler to set up and might integrate well with our JavaScript toolchain. Turborepo shines in speeding up builds/tests by caching previous results and running tasks in parallel, which will be useful as we repeatedly run the suite during migration. If our needs remain straightforward (e.g., mainly just Node/TS projects), Turborepo could be sufficient and quicker to get started​
wisp.blog
. We’ll get excellent build performance with minimal configuration, though it may rely on community plugins for some capabilities that Nx has out-of-the-box.
Recommendation: Given our scope and the desire to standardize across app and data code, Nx is likely the preferred choice for repz-app (and possibly repz-data if it contains multiple services/packages). Nx will help create a structured workspace where, for instance, the mobile app and web app (if we have both) can live as separate projects but share a common library. For repz-data, if it’s a set of Node.js microservices, Nx can also manage those in one repo. Turborepo could still be used if Nx proves too heavy, but since we want robust tooling (and Nx can even integrate with our testing and CI nicely), we lean towards Nx. Either way, the key is to use one of these tools to manage the migration systematically, leveraging their ability to handle multiple projects in one repository with ease​
wisp.blog
. To physically migrate code from old repos:
We will preserve commit history by importing each repository’s git history into the new monorepo. Using git subtree or similar, we can pull the old repo contents into a subfolder of the new repo, so all past commits come along. This ensures we don’t lose git blame information and can trace changes back in time​
medium.com
. Each imported repo might go into a folder like apps/legacyXYZ initially, which we then refactor into the new structure.
Once code is in place, we’ll reorganize directories to a coherent structure. For example, in repz-app (if using Nx), we might have an apps/ directory for each application (maybe web and mobile if applicable) and a libs/ directory for shared libraries (like ui-components, utils, etc.). In repz-data, if using a monorepo approach, we could have a similar split for each microservice. Deciding this structure early (during Week 1-2 planning) will make later steps easier​
medium.com
.
Automated Refactoring (Codemods): After merging code, a lot of references will need updating – e.g., package names, import paths, old brand names. We plan to use codemod tools to automate these repetitive changes. For instance, we can use JSCodeshift or Babel/TypeScript AST transforms to update import statements in bulk (especially if we moved files to new paths or changed library names). If we have an old namespace like @oldbrand/ in imports, a codemod can replace it with @repz/. Similarly, for rebranding text, programmatic search-and-replace (with care for case sensitivity and not altering unintended strings) will be employed. Using codemods allows large-scale code changes with precision and minimal manual effort​
martinfowler.com
 – this is critical to avoid missing occurrences of the old brand or old patterns. We will maintain a script or log of all codemods applied for traceability.
Shared Packages & Design System: To manage code shared across repz-app and repz-data, we will create internal libraries. For example, if both the front-end and back-end use a set of validation rules or data models, we can put those in a shared module (perhaps in repz-app/libs/shared or a new package in a packages/ directory) and have both import from there. This avoids divergence in logic. Our design system (styles, React components, etc.) will be one such shared library – likely living in repz-app repo as a library that the main app imports. We’ll document how to update and use the design system so that even the docs site (repz-docs) can pull in the same style definitions. If repz-docs is a static site (maybe using something like Docusaurus or Next.js for docs), we can publish the design system as an npm package (private to our org) so that repz-docs can consume the same UI components or at least CSS variables, ensuring the documentation site’s look matches the app’s. This approach prevents the “drift” that often happens when multiple repos each have their own styles.
CI/CD Practices for Stability
Maintaining stability during an ongoing migration is paramount. We will set up Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment pipelines from the start in the new repos:
Continuous Integration (CI): Every push or pull request to main (and possibly key branches) of repz-app and repz-data will trigger automated builds and test runs. Using GitHub Actions (given our GitHub-centric workflow) is a straightforward choice – we’ll create workflows for linting, running Jest tests, building the app, and running any end-to-end tests in headless mode. The CI will leverage caching (both Nx and Turborepo support caching) to keep these runs fast. We will also configure branch protection so that PRs cannot be merged unless the CI checks pass, preventing broken code from landing in the main branch.
Continuous Deployment (CD): While the final production deployment will happen at the end of the 12 weeks (for the big release), we want to practice deploying continuously to a staging environment. We will set up a staging deployment (for example, using a separate AWS environment or Vercel/Netlify preview if front-end, and a test server for back-end). Our CD pipeline can deploy repz-app (front-end) to a staged website and repz-data (back-end services) to a staging server on every successful merge to main. This way, throughout the migration, we always have a “live” version of the integrated system to test against. Early visibility is crucial – by frequently deploying, we might catch integration issues (like an API call failing) well before the final release.
Feature Flags for Gradual Integration: To minimize risk, we can use feature flags for big changes where possible. For example, if introducing a new component or altering an algorithm during refactoring, we can keep the old behavior behind a flag and switch it once tested. Similarly, for the rebranded UI, we might develop it behind a toggle – internal users see the new theme in staging, but it’s turned on for all users only at launch. This allows merging code without immediately affecting all end users, giving us flexibility to test and revert if needed.
Monitoring and Alerts: As part of stability, we’ll ensure our logging and monitoring works in the new setup. The repz-data services in staging will have error logging; if any error spikes occur after a migration step, we’ll catch them. We’ll integrate alerts (PagerDuty or simple email alerts) for critical failures in staging so we can react quickly. This is more of a safety net during the migration period.
Throughout the CI/CD process, we’ll use small incremental merges to main. Rather than a huge code drop at once, we’ll aim to integrate one piece at a time (as outlined in the timeline). This incremental approach, combined with continuous testing and deployment, supports fast iteration and quick rollback if something goes wrong, thereby minimizing regressions and giving early visibility into issues (we’ll see problems in CI or staging as soon as they’re introduced).
Managing Shared Components & Design Consistency
A core part of this project is ensuring that the new brand and any common functionality are consistent everywhere:
We will establish a design system library as mentioned, which includes common UI components styled for REPZ (buttons, typography, color themes, etc.). Using a tool like Storybook in the repz-app repo can help us catalogue and visually test these components in isolation. Designers and developers can collaborate through Storybook to ensure components meet the brand guidelines. This library will be version-controlled and changes to it will trigger CI tests (and possibly visual regression tests if we set that up later).
To propagate design changes to repz-docs, we’ll either use the same CSS framework or import the component library. If direct import is complicated (due to different tech stacks), we at least ensure the design tokens (colors, font sizes, spacing rules) are duplicated in the docs site. A single source of truth (like a JSON or CSS-in-JS theme file) might be shared so both the app and docs draw from it.
Shared backend utilities: If repz-app (front-end) and repz-data (back-end) need to share code (for instance, data validation schemas, or constants like units of measurement for workouts), we plan to create a small package for that. With Nx, this could be a library in libs/shared that both the front-end and back-end build can include. If the back-end is not Node.js (say it’s Python or something), we might not share code directly, but we’ll ensure the logic is mirrored and documented to avoid divergence. Possibly, for example, if there’s a formula for computing a training metric, we document it or have tests in both front and back to ensure consistency.
Package Version Management: In a multi-project repo, one risk is multiple versions of the same dependency. We’ll use a single package manager workspace (e.g., npm or Yarn workspaces, or Nx’s built-in tool) to hoist and manage dependencies, so that we don’t end up with inconsistent versions of libraries between app and data. This makes updates easier (upgrade a library once for all parts). Additionally, any custom packages we create (like design system) can be versioned if needed or simply referenced locally if all in one repo, which simplifies development (no need to publish interim versions during active development).
By using these tools and approaches, we aim to make the migration as smooth as possible. The combination of a strong monorepo tool (Nx/Turborepo), automated refactoring, and robust CI/CD will support our goals of fast iteration with minimal breakage. Our emphasis on sharing components and libraries addresses the consolidation’s purpose: to avoid fragmentation and ensure everything is aligned – from how we write code, to how the app looks and feels to users.
Risk Identification and Mitigation
Large-scale repo consolidations and rebrands come with a variety of risks. We have identified common risks and planned mitigation strategies for each:

Risk	Potential Impact	Mitigation Strategy
Breaking Changes (Functional regressions)	Merging codebases may introduce bugs or break existing features. A change in a shared module could ripple across the system​
circleci.com
, causing parts of the app to malfunction. For example, if the API contract between repz-app and repz-data changes inadvertently, user actions might fail.	- Thorough Testing: See Testing Strategy below – extensive unit/E2E tests will catch most issues before release.
- Incremental Migration: Integrate one component/service at a time and verify it in isolation (e.g., after moving the Auth service into repz-data, run all auth-related tests).
- Backwards Compatibility: Where possible, preserve interfaces. If we refactor an API, temporarily adapt the front-end to handle both old and new response formats during transition, or deploy compatibility shims.
- Code Reviews: Dev Lead and QA will scrutinize PRs for any changes that could cause user-facing breaks.
Team Coordination Lapses (Communication gaps)	In a distributed team, miscommunication can lead to duplicate work or missed steps. E.g., two developers might unknowingly work on overlapping modules from different repos, or assume the other handled a certain refactor. Lack of coordination can slow progress or result in integration conflicts.	- Clear Ownership: As defined in the communication plan, each major area has an owner. Tasks are assigned visibly on GitHub Project, reducing overlap.
- Regular Syncs: Weekly meetings and Slack daily updates ensure everyone knows what others are doing. The Project Lead monitors for gaps or unclear areas and will proactively assign or clarify responsibilities.
- Documentation of Decisions: We log architectural decisions and changes in Notion. If a certain approach is agreed (e.g., “use library X for state management in new app”), it’s recorded so all devs follow it, avoiding divergence.
- Pair Programming & Code Reviews: Encourage collaborative coding on tricky parts to spread knowledge and catch issues early. Buddy system can be used (pair up front-end and back-end dev to handle an integration together).
Rollout Confusion (User or stakeholder confusion)	A rebrand can confuse users if not communicated; similarly, internal stakeholders (sales, support) might be caught off guard. If parts of the system show new branding while others lag, it looks unprofessional. Also, URLs or API endpoints might change (e.g., new domain name) causing integration issues for external partners.	- Unified Launch & Messaging: Coordinate the release so that branding changes across app, docs, marketing happen at the same time (or in a clearly staged manner). Avoid half-old, half-new visuals in production. Marketing and comms teams will be looped in to announce the change to users (email, in-app notification, etc.).
- Update All References: Use the code search/codemod to replace old names and logos everywhere. Also update external touchpoints: e.g., if our documentation URL changes to a repz.com domain, set up redirects from the old URL and inform key partners of the change in advance.
- Internal Training: Brief customer support and account managers about the changes. Provide them an FAQ or cheat-sheet on “what’s changing with REPZ” so they can confidently answer user questions.
- Gradual Rollout in Controlled Environments: We might deploy the new app to a small set of beta users or an internal testing group before broad release, to gauge reactions and ensure everything is understood. Gather feedback to clarify any confusing points in UI or messaging.
Merge Conflicts & Code Integration Issues	When combining many repos, especially if development continued in parallel, we risk heavy merge conflicts or integration bugs. There’s also risk of losing some changes if the migration isn’t carefully synced with latest code.	- Freeze and Cutover Plan: Near the time of merging a particular repo, we’ll institute a freeze on that repo (only critical fixes allowed) so we can migrate without new commits diverging. Developers will then work in the new repo.
- Use of Git Tools: Use git subtree or git merge strategies to carry over history and changes systematically. If conflicts occur, resolve them immediately with the original authors involved to ensure correctness.
- Automated Tests on Integration: As soon as code is merged in new repo, run test suites to confirm nothing got lost or broken. This rapid feedback will highlight integration issues to fix right away.
Scope Creep (Adding “just another improvement”)	During migration, the team might be tempted to add extra refactors or new minor features (“while we’re in here, let’s also upgrade X…”). This can threaten the timeline.	- Strict Scope Definition: Clearly define what’s in vs. out for this 12-week project. For example, upgrading a library version is fine if needed to unify repos, but implementing a brand-new feature should be slated for after launch. The Project Lead will validate any change in scope with the product manager or stakeholders.
- Issue Tracking: All tasks go through GitHub Project. New ideas that come up are noted but labeled as “Post-migration” if not essential. We maintain a backlog of nice-to-haves for later, so they don’t distract from core goals.
- Continuous Reminders: In weekly check-ins, reiterate the limited timeframe and goals. The timeline table/milestones in Notion will help visualize if we’re on track or if taking on extra work endangers deadlines.
In addition to the above, we remain mindful of general risks like team member availability (illness or time-off could reduce capacity – we have some buffer in the schedule and cross-training so others can step in) and technical constraints (e.g., if a tool like Nx doesn’t behave as expected, we have alternative plans like switching to Turborepo or a simpler approach). We will keep the Risk Log (on Notion) updated throughout the project, adding new risks as they are identified and tracking the mitigation action items. Each risk will have an owner responsible for managing it. By proactively addressing these risks, we aim to prevent major issues and ensure the migration and rebrand proceed smoothly.
Testing Strategy
A robust testing strategy is crucial to minimize regressions during the migration and to give early visibility into any issues. We will standardize our testing tools across the new codebase and run tests continuously as we integrate components. Here’s our approach:
Unit and Integration Testing (Jest)
We will use Jest as the standard framework for unit tests in all JavaScript/TypeScript projects (which likely covers repz-app and possibly Node portions of repz-data). Jest is already familiar to the team and is easy to configure in a monorepo. Steps and practices:
Standardize Config: Set up a base Jest configuration at the root of each repo (with specific project overrides if needed). This includes configuring coverage thresholds, using Jest watch mode during development, and ensuring tests from all packages can run together without conflict. For example, using Nx, we can leverage the nx affected:test command to only run tests for changed areas on each commit, speeding feedback.
Unit Test Coverage: We will write new unit tests where gaps exist, especially when refactoring legacy code. The QA engineer alongside developers will identify critical modules lacking tests in the old repos and add tests either before or during the migration. Our goal is to cover core functionality (business logic, calculations, state management, etc.) so that if something breaks, a unit test catches it before it goes live.
Integration Tests: For the back-end (repz-data), beyond pure unit tests, we’ll have integration tests (still using Jest or possibly a lighter weight framework) that spin up a minimal environment (for example, test an API endpoint with an in-memory database or stubbed DB). This ensures that when we combine services, they still work end-to-end at the API level. We might use tools like Supertest for HTTP endpoint testing. Similarly, for the front-end, integration tests could cover Redux store interactions or component rendering with the new global styles to catch any runtime issues in the UI.
Test Organization: All tests will live alongside code (co-located in the monorepo structure) or in a __tests__ folder as appropriate. We will use descriptive naming and keep tests updated as we change code. Jest’s snapshot testing can be used for components (to catch any unintended UI changes during rebrand – though we must update snapshots intentionally when applying the new theme).
End-to-End Testing (E2E)
For full user journey testing, we will introduce an end-to-end testing framework. We have two strong candidates:
Cypress: A popular choice known for its developer-friendly interface and powerful capabilities. Cypress runs in a real browser and offers an intuitive API for simulating user actions and verifying results. It has a nice GUI runner which is helpful during development, and it can be run headlessly in CI. We can write E2E tests for critical flows like “user signs up, creates a workout plan, logs a workout, views analytics.” Cypress also has the advantage of automatic waiting and a stable execution environment (same machine as test code), which reduces flakiness.
Playwright: A newer end-to-end framework from Microsoft that supports multiple browsers (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit) and is known for its speed and reliability. Playwright would allow us to test in more browser contexts if needed and has a powerful automation API as well. It’s also easy to integrate into CI and can take screenshots/videos of test runs, which is great for debugging UI issues.
Recommendation: We’ll likely choose Playwright for its robust cross-browser support and modern features. It can simulate user interactions across our web app and even has capabilities to drive mobile emulation if needed. Playwright’s ability to run tests in parallel will help keep our E2E suite fast. That said, if team members are already comfortable with Cypress, we might start with Cypress to get off the ground faster and possibly switch to Playwright long-term. Both are excellent; the key is to have consistent E2E coverage. E2E Test Coverage: The E2E tests will focus on high-level user scenarios:
Basic navigation and page load (ensure that the app loads with the new branding elements).
User authentication (login, logout, signup flows) – must work exactly as before.
Core workout logging workflow (create a workout, add exercises, save, verify it appears in history).
Data display and analytics (check that dashboards or progress charts show up, which might involve seeded test data).
Content verification (for repz-docs: ensure that docs site pages load, links aren’t broken, and new brand name is present instead of old).
Accessibility spot-checks: as part of E2E, we might integrate a tool or two (like Axe) to ensure we didn’t introduce major accessibility regressions with the new UI changes (e.g., contrast issues with the new orange on certain backgrounds).
We will tag critical E2E tests as such and run those more frequently (like on every commit to main), whereas the full E2E suite might run nightly or on a schedule if it becomes lengthy. The idea is to get quick feedback on the smoke-test level scenarios and still regularly verify the broader scenarios.
CI Integration for Testing
All tests (unit, integration, E2E) will be integrated into our CI pipelines:
Pre-merge Checks: As mentioned, every PR should pass the Jest unit test suite. We’ll set up GitHub Action workflows that run npm run test (or nx affected:test) and possibly a subset of E2E (like a smoke test script) on each PR. This prevents obvious breaks from being merged.
Post-merge Builds: On merges to the main branch, the CI will run the full test suite. This includes all unit tests (in case some were skipped due to affected logic on PR – e.g., if someone merges two separate PRs that individually pass but together affect more tests, the main branch run catches it), and the E2E tests in headless mode. We might split this into multiple jobs (parallelize by test type to speed it up). If any of these fail, the team is notified on Slack immediately, and fixing it becomes top priority (treat main branch failures as stop-the-line events).
Continuous Testing Environment: We’ll maintain an environment (or use the staging deployment) where the latest code is always deployed, and we can run E2E tests against that environment. Playwright/Cypress can run against localhost in CI, but also can be pointed to a deployed URL. We might do both: run against a local instance for speed, and run a nightly E2E against the staging deployment for an extra layer of confidence (this can catch environment-specific issues).
Performance Tests in CI: Not strictly asked, but to ensure we didn’t regress app performance, we could include a simple Lighthouse CI or performance budget check for the front-end (especially since we are adding new assets for branding). This would alert us if page load times or bundle sizes exceed a certain threshold after the migration.
CI Stability: Flaky tests can undermine confidence, so we will guard against that by using reliable data seeding (each test should start with a known state, using test accounts or resetting the database in a known way). If some tests are consistently flaky, we address the root cause rather than ignoring them. The goal is a “green” test suite that truly indicates all clear.
Migration Test Checklist
To ensure critical functionality is covered during the migration, we will maintain a Migration Test Checklist. This is a list of features and system aspects that must be verified in the new consolidated platform (either via automated tests or manual QA if needed). Below is an outline of this checklist:
 User Authentication Flows: Verify login, logout, account creation, and password reset work with the new system (no broken redirects, sessions carry over, etc.).
 Workout Logging & Tracking: Ensure users can log a workout (add exercises, sets, reps) and that the data saves correctly to the database via repz-data. Retrieve and display logged workouts in history.
 Analytics & Progress Displays: Check that all data-driven elements (charts, personal records, progress summaries) function and calculate correctly. This includes verifying any calculations (e.g., one-rep max estimations) are consistent with pre-migration results.
 Training Plan Management: If the app allows creating or following training programs, test creating a plan, editing it, and marking workouts complete. Ensure notifications or scheduling features around this still work.
 API Integrations: If any third-party integrations exist (e.g., syncing with wearables or other fitness apps, or payment processing for premium features), test those endpoints in the new setup. They should hit the new repz-data services without issues (and any external API keys or webhooks should be updated to new URLs if needed).
 Responsive UI & Mobile Support: With the new branding and any CSS changes, verify the app looks correct on various screen sizes. Particularly, check mobile views (if a web app) or the mobile app if we have one, to ensure UI elements (like the bright orange accents) are visually pleasing and accessible.
 Documentation Accuracy: Scan through the repz-docs site after migration. Check that all pages render, that links between pages work (no 404s), and that old product name references are replaced with “REPZ”. Also ensure code snippets or examples in docs are updated if the code structure changed (for example, if we document an API endpoint path that changed, update it).
 Performance Benchmarks: Compare key performance metrics (page load time, API response time for heavy operations, etc.) before and after migration. The consolidation shouldn’t degrade performance. If any metric regresses significantly, flag it for optimization.
 Security Checks: Run through a basic security regression: ensure role-based access controls still hold (no leakage of data between accounts), any new code doesn’t introduce XSS/SQL injection (our CI linting and tests should catch, but a manual pen-test mindset review is good). Also verify that secrets (API keys, etc.) are correctly handled in new repos (maybe using a .env or GitHub Secrets, nothing leaked).
 Old Links Redirects: If the rebrand involves changing URLs (for instance, old domain or paths to new ones), test that common old URLs properly redirect or display a helpful message. For example, if docs moved, the old docs link should redirect to the new docs homepage. Similarly, any old API endpoints should either be forwarded or give a clear error with info.
 Accessibility & UX Review: Conduct an accessibility test pass (manual or with tooling) on critical screens with the new color scheme (orange/black). Ensure text has sufficient contrast, and the app remains navigable by keyboard and screen readers. This is especially important after a style overhaul.
This checklist will be posted in Notion (and possibly as GitHub issues linked to the testing phase) and each item will be checked off as we validate it. Many of these will be covered by automated tests, but some (like visual checks or performance comparisons) might be done manually by QA or developers. We plan to complete the checklist by the end of week 10 (Testing & Stabilization phase), so that weeks 11-12 can focus on any fixes for items that didn’t pass initially.
Additional Testing Practices
Regression Testing: We’ll maintain a small set of legacy baseline tests from the old system (if available, e.g., if the old repos had tests or if we can write some before moving). After migration, we run them (adapted to new structure) to ensure outputs remain the same. This is to double-check that, for example, a calculation algorithm in the old code returns the same result in the new code.
Smoke Tests for Deployment: For each deployment (staging or production), prepare a short smoke test script (could be automated or a manual checklist) that the team runs through immediately post-deploy. This might include simply hitting the home page, logging in with a test account, and ensuring no obvious errors. This quick check acts as final verification in the live environment.
Test Data Management: We will use a consistent set of test data (users, workouts, etc.) across our testing environments. Possibly create a “demo account” with pre-filled data that we use in both automated tests and manual exploratory testing to see the state of the app with realistic content. This helps catch issues in data migration or differences in how new code reads old data.
By executing this comprehensive testing strategy, we aim to catch issues early and often. The combination of Jest unit tests (fast, run on every change) and Playwright/Cypress E2E tests (full workflow coverage) under a continuous integration regime will give us confidence that the REPZ platform remains stable and reliable throughout the 12-week migration. Moreover, the explicit checklist of critical functionalities ensures that we verify each important aspect of the system before declaring the migration complete. Ultimately, our testing emphasis supports fast iteration with safe nets – we can move quickly with refactoring and consolidating code because our tests will alert us to any misstep, thus enabling the team to maintain momentum without fear of hidden breakages. This approach, combined with our communication plan and risk mitigations, will help ensure a successful rebrand and consolidation for the REPZ platform.
