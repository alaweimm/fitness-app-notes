Chapter 1: Anabolic-Androgenic Steroids
Overview
Anabolic-androgenic steroids (AAS) are synthetic derivatives of testosterone designed to maximize tissue-building (anabolic) effects while minimizing masculinizing (androgenic) effects. Medically, AAS are prescribed for conditions like hypogonadism, delayed puberty, muscle wasting, and anemia. However, they are frequently misused in sports and bodybuilding for their ability to dramatically increase muscle mass and strength. AAS exert their effects by binding to the androgen receptor, stimulating protein synthesis and muscle cell growth. They also influence gene expression in muscle and bone, leading to hypertrophy and increased bone density.
History:
The anabolic properties of testosterone were recognized in the 1930s, leading to the synthesis of numerous analogues over subsequent decades. AAS use in sports became widespread by the 1950s–1960s (notably Dianabol in Olympic weightlifting). By the 1980s, non-medical AAS use had grown, prompting many countries to classify them as controlled substances. Despite bans, AAS remain prevalent in competitive bodybuilding and certain sports, illicitly.
Forms and Administration:
AAS are available as injectable compounds (often esterified to alter release rate) and oral agents (usually 17α-alkylated for oral bioavailability). Common injectable AAS include various testosterone esters (e.g., enanthate, cypionate, propionate), nandrolone (Deca-Durabolin), boldenone (Equipoise), trenbolone, methenolone (Primobolan), and drostanolone (Masteron). Popular oral AAS include methandrostenolone (Dianabol), oxandrolone (Anavar), stanozolol (Winstrol), oxymetholone (Anadrol), and methyltestosterone. Orals typically have shorter half-lives and greater liver strain due to 17α-alkylation, whereas injectables bypass first-pass metabolism (less liver toxicity).
Anabolic vs Androgenic Effects:
Anabolic effects include enhanced muscle protein synthesis, nitrogen retention, and satellite cell activation, translating to increased muscle size and strength. Androgenic effects include male sexual characteristic development (facial/body hair, deepening voice) and effects like acne and scalp hair loss (in predisposed individuals). Different AAS have varying anabolic:androgenic ratios. For example, testosterone has a baseline ratio of 100:100. Some synthetic AAS are designed to have a higher anabolic ratio (e.g., oxandrolone’s ratio is cited as 300:24), but in practice all AAS exert both anabolic and androgenic actions to some degree, especially at supraphysiologic doses.
Benefits (Desired Effects):
In a performance context, AAS can significantly increase lean muscle mass, strength, and power. Users often report faster recovery from intense workouts, increased training aggressiveness, and reduced fatigue. AAS also can increase bone density and red blood cell production (erythropoiesis). Clinically, they can restore normal physiology in hypogonadal men (improving libido, energy, mood) and counteract catabolic states (e.g., severe illness or prolonged corticosteroid use).
Risks and Adverse Effects:
AAS misuse is associated with a spectrum of adverse effects across multiple organ systems. Common side effects include acne, oily skin, and accelerated male-pattern baldness (due to androgenic activity). AAS can disrupt the endogenous hormone axis, causing testicular atrophy and infertility via suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis. Estrogenic side effects occur with aromatizable AAS (e.g., testosterone, Dianabol): excess estrogen can cause gynecomastia (male breast tissue growth) and water retention. Progestogenic compounds (19-nor AAS like nandrolone, trenbolone) may induce sexual dysfunction (decreased libido, erectile issues) and gynecomastia through progestin activity.
Long-term AAS abuse carries serious risks. Cardiovascular complications are among the most significant: AAS can adversely alter cholesterol (lower HDL, raise LDL), increase blood pressure, and cause left ventricular hypertrophy, accelerating atherosclerosis. Chronic use has been linked to cardiomyopathy and arrhythmias, increasing the risk of myocardial infarction and sudden cardiac death. Hepatotoxicity is a concern particularly with oral 17α-alkylated steroids (like oxymetholone, stanozolol, Dianabol); these can cause elevated liver enzymes, cholestasis, and rarely liver tumors or peliosis hepatis. Psychiatric effects include mood swings, aggression (“roid rage”), irritability, and in some users, anxiety or depression—especially upon withdrawal. Endocrine effects in males include testicular shrinkage, low sperm count, and infertility; in females, virilization can occur (deepened voice, clitoromegaly, hirsutism, menstrual irregularities). Many adverse effects are dose-dependent and may be reversible upon cessation, but others (like cardiac or hepatic structural changes) can be permanent.
Use Cases:
In bodybuilding, AAS are used in bulking phases to maximize muscle gain, and in cutting phases (often with non-aromatizable AAS) to preserve muscle while dieting. Athletes in strength, power, or speed sports have used AAS to improve performance, though testing regimes increase the risk. In therapeutic settings, carefully monitored doses of AAS (e.g., testosterone replacement therapy or oxandrolone for burn patients) can yield significant functional improvements. AAS are also used illicitly by individuals simply desiring an aesthetic muscular appearance or anti-aging effects (despite health risks).
Dosing and Cycling Strategies:
Athletes often organize AAS use into cycles—periods of 6–16 weeks “on” followed by time off (or cruising on low dose). During cycles, multiple AAS might be stacked to synergize effects (for example, an injectable base like testosterone with an oral kickstarter like Dianabol, or combining a bulking agent with a more androgenic compound for hardness). Doses in abuse can far exceed therapeutic levels; for instance, a common beginner cycle might use 300–500 mg testosterone enanthate per week (vs. 100 mg/week in TRT), whereas advanced users might take grams of combined AAS weekly.
To illustrate, consider a 12-week bulking cycle:
Weeks 1–12: Testosterone Enanthate 500 mg/week (in two split injections)
Weeks 1–10: Nandrolone Decanoate 300 mg/week
Weeks 1–4: Dianabol 30 mg/day (oral kick-start)
Weeks 1–12: Aromatase inhibitor (e.g., Arimidex 0.5 mg every other day, as needed to control estrogen)
Then followed by post-cycle therapy (PCT). In this example, testosterone provides a base androgen, nandrolone adds anabolic synergy (with less androgenic side effect than an equivalent extra dose of testosterone), and Dianabol provides rapid strength/size gains early on (while longer-ester injectables build up).
Alternatively, in a cutting cycle, one might use:
Weeks 1–8: Testosterone Propionate 100 mg every other day
Weeks 1–8: Trenbolone Acetate 75 mg every other day
Weeks 3–8: Oxandrolone 50 mg/day (oral)
Weeks 1–8: Arimidex 0.5 mg every other day (to control estrogen from testosterone)
Weeks 5–8: Optional Winstrol 50 mg/day (instead of or in addition to Oxandrolone) for extra hardness.
This combination aims to preserve muscle and strength on a calorie-deficit diet while promoting fat loss and a “hard,” dry look. Trenbolone is a potent androgen that does not aromatize, helping with recomposition, but it carries a high risk of side effects. It can negatively impact cardiovascular health severely (lipids, endothelial function) and is notorious for reducing aerobic capacity. Cycling strategies vary widely. Some users pyramid doses (ramp up then down), although there’s little scientific support for its necessity. Others do blast and cruise: blasting high doses for a cycle, then cruising on a low “maintenance” dose of testosterone instead of coming off completely (often akin to TRT dosing). This avoids the hormonal crash of PCT but means essentially remaining on steroids year-round, with attendant long-term risks.
A beginner’s first AAS cycle might be:
Weeks 1–10: Testosterone Cypionate 300–500 mg per week.
Weeks 1–10: Optional – Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (hCG) 250 IU twice weekly (to maintain testicular function during the cycle).
Weeks 1–10: Anastrozole 0.5 mg every other day as needed if estrogenic side effects occur (to manage estrogen).
Post-Cycle: Begin PCT 2 weeks after last injection using clomiphene (Clomid) 50 mg and tamoxifen (Nolvadex) 20 mg daily for 4 weeks.
This cycle uses a single long-ester testosterone, which is straightforward and relatively safer for a novice to gauge response. PCT is incorporated to help restore natural testosterone production.
Profile of Selected Compounds
Below are profiles of some commonly used AAS, detailing their unique characteristics:
Testosterone (base compound): Forms: Injectables (enanthate, cypionate, propionate, Sustanon blend), transdermal gels/creams, oral undecanoate (rare). Half-life: varies by ester (Propionate ~2 days, Enanthate/Cypionate ~7–8 days). Typical Dose: TRT ~100 mg/week; performance 300–1000+ mg/week. Characteristics: The gold-standard anabolic to which others are compared (anabolic:androgenic ratio 100:100). Aromatizes to estrogen (estradiol) and can cause significant mass gain (including water). Supports libido, mood, and energy. Side Effects: estrogenic (gyno, water retention), androgenic (acne, hair loss); suppressive to HPG axis. Often used as the base of any steroid stack to maintain physiological function (since other AAS may not sufficiently activate all androgenic functions).
Nandrolone (Deca-Durabolin): Half-life: Decanoate ester ~15 days. Anabolic/androgenic ratio: 125:37. Dose: 200–600 mg/week. Pros: Strong anabolic for muscle and joint recovery; tends to improve collagen synthesis and joint pain. Lower direct androgenic effects on hair/skin (a 19-nor steroid with reduced androgenic activity in some tissues). Minimal aromatization to estrogen (though it does convert to a weaker estrogen). Cons: Strongly suppressive to the HPG axis. Can elevate prolactin, leading to “Deca Dick” (erectile dysfunction and low libido in the absence of sufficient testosterone) – often mitigated by co-administering testosterone and/or a dopamine agonist (cabergoline, pramipexole). Unique: Deca’s long ester means slow clearance; it’s popular in bulking stacks and typically run longer (12+ weeks). Detectable for a long time in drug tests due to metabolite persistence.
Trenbolone: Forms: Trenbolone Acetate (half-life ~2 days), Trenbolone Enanthate (~7 days). Anabolic/androgenic ratio: often cited as 500:500 (extremely potent in both aspects). Dose: 150–400 mg/week (acetate often 50–100 mg every other day). Pros: Exceptionally powerful for muscle building and recomposition; no aromatization (does not convert to estrogen), so it produces a hard, dry look; increases IGF-1 in muscle; great strength gains. Cons: Very high androgenic side effects: night sweats, insomnia, high blood pressure, aggression, anxiety (“tren rage”), possible neurotoxicity. Progestogenic activity can cause gyno even without estrogen (via prolactin). Trenbolone’s harsh side-effect profile makes it an advanced-user drug only. It can negatively impact cardiovascular health severely (affecting lipids and endothelial function) and is notorious for reducing aerobic capacity (some users report decreased endurance on tren).
Chapter 2: Peptides and Growth Factors
2.1 Growth Hormone (GH) and Secretagogues
Human Growth Hormone (GH) is an anabolic peptide hormone produced by the pituitary gland, stimulating growth and cell reproduction. GH secretagogues (GHS) are compounds that stimulate the body’s own GH release. These include peptides like GHRP-2, GHRP-6, Ipamorelin, Hexarelin, and synthetic compounds like MK-677 (Ibutamoren).
Uses: Athletes and anti-aging enthusiasts use GH or secretagogues to promote muscle growth, fat loss, and recovery. GH increases IGF-1 production in the liver, contributing to anabolic effects. Secretagogues offer a way to boost GH without exogenous hormone injection.
Dosing: GH is often dosed 2–6 IU/day for performance or physique enhancement (much higher in clinical settings for deficient individuals). Secretagogues like MK-677 are taken orally (e.g., 25 mg/day), whereas peptides like Ipamorelin are injected subcutaneously 1–3 times daily.
Benefits: GH can increase lean mass, reduce fat, improve recovery and injury repair, and support collagen synthesis (better skin, joint health). Users often report improved sleep and well-being.
Side Effects: GH excess can cause joint pain, carpal tunnel syndrome, insulin resistance (raising blood sugar), water retention, and, in long-term high doses, acromegaly (enlargement of facial features, hands, feet). Secretagogues can have similar milder effects; MK-677 may increase appetite significantly.
Secretagogues vs GH: Secretagogues (like GHRPs or MK-677) cause pulsatile GH release and are often cheaper and easier (oral MK-677) than injectable GH. However, GH injections guarantee elevated levels and are more controllable. Many users start with secretagogues and graduate to GH if needed.
2.2 Healing and Tissue Repair Peptides
One of the most exciting aspects of peptide therapy is injury healing and reducing downtime. Several peptides have been found to promote regeneration of tendons, ligaments, muscle, and other tissues:
BPC-157 (Body Protection Compound-157): A 15-amino-acid peptide derived from a protein in gastric juice. BPC-157 has gained popularity for its remarkable regenerative properties across many tissue types.
Effects: Enhances healing of tendons, ligaments, muscle, nervous tissue, and even gut lining. It works by upregulating growth factors and angiogenesis (formation of new blood vessels). People use it for tendon injuries (tennis elbow, Achilles tendonitis), muscle tears, and even stomach ulcers or intestinal inflammation.
Administration: Typically injected subcutaneously near the injury site (if applicable) at 250–500 mcg once or twice daily. Oral capsules exist for gut-specific issues, and many anecdotal reports claim benefit for gut healing from oral use (BPC-157 is stable in gastric acid).
Safety: BPC-157 has shown minimal side effects in research. It’s a natural gastric peptide fragment, so the body tolerates it well. No known toxicity at typical doses.
Real-world: Many athletes credit BPC-157 for accelerating healing of stubborn injuries, sometimes cutting down rehab time significantly. It’s often combined with TB-500 for a synergistic effect.
TB-500 (Thymosin Beta-4): Thymosin Beta-4 is a peptide present in most tissues; it plays a role in healing, cell migration, and new blood vessel formation. TB-500 refers to the synthetic version (a 43-amino-acid peptide).
Effects: Noted for promoting wound repair and reducing inflammation. TB-500 helps regrow blood vessels and muscle tissue, and has anti-fibrotic properties (reduces scar tissue formation). It’s systemic—often used when someone has multiple or diffuse injuries or wants overall recovery enhancement.
Dosing: A common protocol is 2–5 mg injected subcutaneously twice per week for 4–6 weeks, then a maintenance dose monthly.
Results: Many report improved recovery from intense training, relief from tendonitis, and greater flexibility. It may help with chronic injuries by improving tissue quality.
Side Effects: Virtually none acutely; some people note temporary lethargy or headache. As a naturally occurring peptide, it’s well tolerated. Long term, theoretically, excessive blood vessel growth could be a concern, but this hasn’t been evidenced clinically.
Combining BPC-157 and TB-500: Common practice – BPC is often injected locally for pinpoint repair, TB-500 systemically. This dual approach covers healing from two angles.
Real-world example: A powerlifter with a partial muscle tear might use TB-500 5 mg/week and BPC-157 500 mcg/day near the injury. Many anecdotal reports of significant healing acceleration with this combo.
Other Repair Peptides: CJC-1295 (with DAC) and Tesamorelin (a GH-releasing hormone analog) can indirectly aid injury repair via increased GH/IGF-1. GHK-Cu (Copper peptide) applied topically or injected may improve skin, soft tissue, and even hair growth due to regenerative effects.
2.3 Metabolic and Weight Loss Peptides
Certain peptides can enhance metabolism or assist in weight loss through various mechanisms:
HGH Frag 176-191: A fragment of the GH molecule (amino acids 176–191) modified to aid fat loss without full GH effects.
Use: Often injected subcutaneously at 250–500 mcg/day (usually split into two doses).
Effects: Stimulates lipolysis (fat breakdown) and inhibits lipogenesis (fat formation). Users incorporate it into cutting regimens to enhance fat loss, especially stubborn fat.
Note: Unlike GH, Frag 176-191 has minimal effect on insulin or IGF-1 levels, focusing largely on fat burning. Side effects are few (possible redness at injection site, slight lethargy).
CJC-1295 + Ipamorelin Combo: A popular peptide combo for weight management and body composition.
Use: CJC-1295 (a GHRH analog) plus Ipamorelin (a GHRP) together amplify GH pulses. Typical dosing is CJC-1295 ~100 mcg + Ipamorelin ~100 mcg per injection, 1–3 times daily (often pre-sleep).
Effects: Increases GH/IGF-1 levels, thereby supporting fat loss, muscle maintenance, and improved recovery. While not purely “weight loss” peptides, the increase in GH can tilt metabolism towards fat use.
Considerations: Minimal side effects beyond those of GH itself (some water retention or tingling). They are often used in place of GH therapy due to lower cost.
Melanotan II: Primarily known as a tanning peptide, it also tends to reduce appetite.
Use: Injected at ~0.5–1 mg a few times per week. It causes the skin to darken (melanogenesis) over time.
Effects: Aside from tanning and increasing libido in some, many users experience appetite suppression and slight nausea—leading to weight loss as a side effect.
Caution: Melanotan II can cause nausea, flushing, and in some cases, new mole formation or darkening of freckles. Users must monitor skin changes.
ADA (Adipotide): An experimental peptide that induces apoptosis (cell death) in fat blood vessels.
Status: Largely research-phase. Shown in animal studies to cause rapid fat loss by eliminating fat cell blood supply.
Use: Not commercially available for human use; some labs have produced it for research. Dosing and safety in humans are not well-established.
Note: Mentioned here for completeness as a metabolic peptide, but it’s not in mainstream use due to safety concerns.
Chapter 3: SARMs and Non-Steroidal Anabolic Agents
Selective Androgen Receptor Modulators (SARMs) are compounds that selectively stimulate androgen receptors in muscle and bone, aiming to promote anabolic effects with fewer side effects than steroids. Other non-steroidal anabolic agents include compounds with anabolic activity that are not traditional AAS or SARMs.
3.1 Profiles of Select SARMs
Ostarine (MK-2866): A well-known SARM often used in cutting or recomposition phases.
Dose: 10–25 mg/day.
Benefits: Promotes modest muscle gains or retention, with fat loss and improved muscle hardness. Minimal liver toxicity and no conversion to estrogen.
Side Effects: At recommended doses, low risk of hair loss or prostate issues; mild HPG axis suppression at higher/longer dosing.
Unique: Often considered the “entry-level” SARM; commonly used as a bridge between cycles or to help recover post-cycle (though it still suppresses testosterone somewhat).
Ligandrol (LGD-4033): A stronger bulking-oriented SARM.
Dose: 5–10 mg/day.
Effects: Noticeable increases in muscle mass and strength over 8–12 weeks. Can increase appetite.
Side Effects: Greater HPG suppression than Ostarine, potential slight increase in liver enzymes, and some reports of testicular suppression, so PCT is often recommended.
Unique: Its potency approaches lower-end steroid cycles in effect, making it attractive for users not ready for injectables.
Andarine (S4): A SARM often used for cutting.
Dose: 25–50 mg/day (often split).
Benefits: Improves muscle hardness, vascularity, and aids fat loss. Helps preserve muscle on a cut.
Side Effects: Notable for causing a reversible vision side effect (night vision difficulty or yellow tint). Moderately suppressive.
Unique: The vision sides are its hallmark; otherwise, it stacks well with other SARMs for recomposition.
RAD-140 (Testolone): A very potent SARM, sometimes considered “SARM testosterone.”
Dose: 10–20 mg/day.
Effects: Significant increases in lean mass and strength. Some users compare its results to a low-dose testosterone cycle.
Side Effects: Likely HPG axis suppression, potential rise in liver enzymes and cholesterol changes. Some report increased aggression or anxiety.
Unique: One of the strongest SARMs available; currently in research for possible use in muscle-wasting diseases.
3.2 Results and Side Effects in Practice
Real-world use of SARMs has produced mixed outcomes. Many users report satisfying gains in muscle and strength with fewer side effects than steroids. However, labs have found that some “SARM” products are impure or spiked with actual steroids, contributing to side effects.
Stacking SARMs: Users often stack SARMs (e.g., Ostarine + S4 for a cut, or LGD + RAD-140 for a lean bulk). Stacking can amplify results but also increases suppression and risk of side effects, requiring careful PCT.
Side Effect Management: While SARMs don’t aromatize, high doses can cause testosterone suppression comparable to steroids, so PCT (with SERMs like Nolvadex/Clomid) is used. Liver support (e.g., NAC) is advised for SARMs that may impact liver values (RAD-140, YK-11). Vision issues with S4 are dose-dependent; many users do 5 days on, 2 days off to mitigate them.
Long-Term Unknowns: The long-term health effects of SARMs aren’t fully known. There is concern over potential toxicity not immediately evident in short trials (e.g., on heart or cancer risk). As such, users treating SARMs as a “safe” alternative should still exercise caution and get bloodwork.
Non-Steroidal Anabolics: This category can include substances like beta-2 agonists (e.g., Clenbuterol, which is not a SARM but has anabolic effects in animals) or myostatin inhibitors. These agents aren’t androgens but can promote anabolism through other pathways. Clenbuterol, for example, is often used for fat loss but also has some anti-catabolic properties in muscle.
Chapter 4: Nootropics and Cognitive Enhancers
Nootropics are compounds aimed at improving cognitive function, memory, creativity, or motivation. They range from prescription stimulants to herbal supplements.
4.1 Stimulants for Focus and Alertness
Caffeine: The world’s most consumed stimulant. Improves alertness, concentration, and reduces fatigue by blocking adenosine receptors.
Dose: 50–300 mg (higher doses for tolerance; 100 mg is roughly a cup of coffee).
Pros: Increases wakefulness and focus, mild mood elevation, readily available.
Cons: Can cause jitteriness, anxiety, insomnia, and tolerance build-up. Withdrawal can lead to headaches and fatigue.
Unique: Often combined with L-Theanine (found in tea) at ~200 mg each; this combo smooths out caffeine’s jittery edge.
Adderall (mixed amphetamine salts): A prescription stimulant for ADHD that increases dopamine and norepinephrine.
Dose: 5–30 mg (immediate or extended-release).
Effects: Strong improvements in focus, drive, and alertness; can significantly enhance sustained concentration and reduce impulsivity.
Side Effects: Elevated heart rate/blood pressure, insomnia, appetite suppression, potential for anxiety or irritability, and highly habit-forming.
Unique: Known as a “study drug,” but nonmedical use carries risks of dependency and cardiovascular strain.
Modafinil (Provigil): A wakefulness-promoting agent prescribed for narcolepsy, used off-label for cognitive enhancement.
Dose: 100–200 mg in the morning.
Pros: Increases alertness and resistance to fatigue without the euphoria or jitteriness of traditional stimulants. Many report enhanced focus and mild mood lift.
Cons: Can cause headaches, nausea, or anxiety in some. Rarely, serious rashes (Stevens-Johnson syndrome) — although very uncommon.
Unique: Does not typically produce a “high,” so it’s considered lower abuse potential. Often used by professionals for long workdays or shift work.
4.2 Nootropic Compounds (Racetams and more)
Piracetam: The original racetam nootropic.
Dose: 1,200–4,800 mg/day (split into 2–3 doses).
Effects: Claimed to enhance memory, learning, and verbal fluency. Works by modulating neurotransmitters (like acetylcholine) and neuroprotection.
Side Effects: Generally few; some users report headaches (often mitigated by choline supplementation), gastrointestinal discomfort, or nervousness.
Unique: Often taken with choline (like Alpha-GPC) for synergistic effect on memory and to prevent headaches.
Aniracetam: A fat-soluble racetam with anxiolytic (anxiety-reducing) properties.
Dose: 750–1,500 mg/day (split).
Effects: Improves memory and focus, and many users report feeling less anxious or stressed. It’s faster-acting but shorter-lived than Piracetam.
Cons: Short duration means multiple doses needed. Bitter taste. Some report fatigue if taken without choline.
Unique: Has mild AMPA receptor modulatory effects, contributing to cognitive enhancement and mood support.
Noopept: A peptide-like nootropic often classed with racetams (though structurally distinct).
Dose: 10–30 mg/day.
Effects: Cognitive clarity, improved memory recall, and neuroprotective potential. It’s much more potent by weight than racetams.
Side Effects: Possible irritability or headache at higher doses; generally well-tolerated.
Unique: Believed to increase BDNF (brain-derived neurotrophic factor) and NGF (nerve growth factor) levels, possibly aiding long-term brain health.
Others: Phenylpiracetam (stimulating, boosts physical endurance), Coluracetam (may enhance vision contrast), and Pramiracetam (strong focus booster) are additional racetams each with specific nuances in effect and potency. They often require trial and error to see individual response.
4.3 Cholinergics and Memory
Alpha-GPC: A choline source that converts to acetylcholine in the brain.
Dose: 300–600 mg/day.
Effects: Supports memory and cognitive function, often stacked with racetams. Can increase power output in athletes (as a bonus).
Side Effects: High doses can cause headaches or gastrointestinal upset; lower blood pressure in some.
Unique: Frequently used to potentiate racetams and eliminate racetam-associated headaches.
Huperzine A: An acetylcholinesterase inhibitor (prevents breakdown of acetylcholine).
Dose: 50–200 mcg 2–4 times per day (cycling recommended to avoid tolerance).
Effects: Raises acetylcholine levels, which can improve memory, learning, and mental clarity.
Side Effects: Can cause acetylcholine overload in high dose or sensitive individuals: nausea, diarrhea, muscle cramps, or insomnia.
Unique: Derived from club moss; often included in memory supplements and studied for potential Alzheimer’s benefits.
Centrophenoxine: A cholinergic compound that both supplies choline and acts as a neuroprotective agent.
Dose: 250–1,000 mg/day.
Effects: May improve memory and have anti-aging effects on the brain (shown to reduce lipofuscin accumulation in cells).
Side Effects: Mild headaches, gastrointestinal issues, or mood changes in some.
Unique: It’s also considered a mild stimulant and mood enhancer by some users.
4.4 Adaptogens and Others for Brain Health
Rhodiola Rosea: An herbal adaptogen.
Dose: ~300–500 mg/day (standardized to rosavins).
Effects: Reduces mental fatigue, improves stress resilience, and can enhance mood. Useful for combating burnout.
Side Effects: At higher doses can be stimulating or, conversely, cause sedation in some; possible dry mouth or jitteriness.
Unique: Often taken in the morning to avoid interference with sleep. Effects can be subtle but noticeable under stress.
Bacopa Monnieri: An Ayurvedic herb traditionally used for memory and anxiety.
Dose: 300 mg/day (standardized to bacosides).
Effects: Improves memory recall and retention over chronic use (several weeks); reduces anxiety and helps with mental clarity.
Side Effects: Can cause digestive upset; some experience increased bowel movements. Requires weeks of consistent use for full effects.
Unique: Particularly popular for students as a study aid taken throughout a semester.
Ashwagandha (Withania Somnifera): An adaptogen and mild nootropic.
Dose: 300–600 mg/day (extract) or 2–5 g root powder.
Effects: Reduces anxiety and stress, can improve sleep quality, and indirectly may aid cognitive function by lowering cortisol and anxiety.
Side Effects: Generally well-tolerated; large doses may cause stomach upset or drowsiness.
Unique: Has supportive effects on thyroid function and may boost testosterone slightly in men (added benefits beyond cognition).
Lion’s Mane Mushroom (Hericium erinaceus): A medicinal mushroom touted for cognitive benefits.
Dose: 500–1,000 mg of extract 2–3 times daily.
Effects: May promote nerve growth factor (NGF) release, aiding neurogenesis. Users report improved focus and slight mood enhancement over weeks.
Side Effects: Very few; it’s essentially an edible mushroom. Some might have allergies.
Unique: Being researched for neuroprotective properties and potential in neurodegenerative conditions.
4.5 Sleep Enhancers (Recovery and Cognitive Function)
Melatonin: A hormone regulating sleep-wake cycles.
Dose: 0.5–5 mg at night.
Effects: Improves sleep onset and quality, especially useful for jet lag or shift work. Indirectly benefits cognition by ensuring restorative sleep.
Side Effects: Grogginess if dose too high, vivid dreams; long-term high-dose use may desensitize receptors (use lowest effective dose).
Unique: Not a sedative per se; works by signaling darkness to the body.
Magnesium (Glycinate or Threonate): A mineral aiding relaxation.
Dose: 200–400 mg elemental magnesium before bed.
Effects: Calms the nervous system, can improve sleep quality and muscle relaxation. Magnesium Threonate specifically may cross the blood-brain barrier and support cognition.
Side Effects: Excess can cause diarrhea (especially with citrate form); glycinate is gentler on gut.
Unique: Many adults are mildly magnesium-deficient; supplementation can have broad wellness effects (mood, stress, sleep).
L-Theanine: An amino acid from tea leaves that promotes relaxation without sedation.
Dose: 100–300 mg (often taken with caffeine during day, or alone in evening).
Effects: Reduces mental stress and improves sleep quality. Synergistic with caffeine (smooths jitters) and with melatonin (may enhance sleep).
Side Effects: Extremely few; very safe profile.
Unique: In some countries sold as an anxiolytic. Commonly used by those who want to wind down mentally in the evening.
GABA Supplements: GABA is the primary inhibitory neurotransmitter (though direct oral GABA has limited ability to cross into brain).
Dose: 500–1,000 mg at night.
Effects: Some report improved relaxation and quicker sleep onset.
Note: Because GABA doesn’t easily cross the blood-brain barrier, effects may be peripheral (relaxation via body). Phenibut (a GABA derivative) does cross, but it’s not recommended due to tolerance and dependence risk.
4.6 Other Cognitive Agents
Creatine: Better known as a fitness supplement, creatine also supports cognitive function.
Dose: 5 g/day.
Effects: Increases brain phosphocreatine, helping with quick energy turnover in neurons. Studies show it can improve memory and intelligence, particularly in vegetarians or during sleep deprivation.
Side Effects: Weight gain (from water retention in muscles), stomach cramp if taken without enough water.
Unique: One of the most researched supplements, with multifaceted benefits (cognitive and physical).
Omega-3 Fatty Acids (Fish Oil/DHA): Critical for brain health and cognitive performance.
Dose: ~1–2 g combined EPA/DHA daily.
Effects: Supports membrane fluidity in neurons, anti-inflammatory effects in the brain; associated with improved mood, memory, and reduced cognitive decline risk.
Side Effects: Fishy burps (mitigate with enteric-coated or taking with meals), high doses may thin blood slightly.
Unique: DHA is the key omega-3 for brain; algae-based supplements exist for vegetarians.
Adaptogen Mixes: Combination formulas (e.g., “NSI-189” in research for neurogenesis, or herbal mixes like Panax Ginseng + Ginkgo Biloba).
Panax Ginseng: May improve working memory and calmness (200–400 mg of extract).
Ginkgo Biloba: Improves blood flow to the brain; modest memory benefits in some (120–240 mg/day).
Phosphatidylserine: A phospholipid that can blunt cortisol and improve memory (100 mg 3x/day studied).
Note: Many of these provide subtle benefits or help under stress rather than dramatic acute effects.
Chapter 5: Anti-Aging and Longevity Compounds
5.1 Metformin
Metformin is a prescription medication for Type 2 diabetes that’s being explored for anti-aging due to its effects on metabolism and cellular processes.
Mechanism: It reduces liver glucose production and increases insulin sensitivity. It also activates AMPK, a cellular energy sensor linked to longevity.
Longevity Benefits: Epidemiological studies show diabetics on metformin outlive non-diabetics not on metformin. It may reduce incidence of cancer and cardiovascular disease. Some believe it mimics caloric restriction benefits.
Dose (for longevity): 500–2,000 mg/day (start low to avoid GI upset). Often 500 mg with breakfast and dinner.
Side Effects: Gastrointestinal distress (bloating, diarrhea) especially initially, B12 malabsorption (long-term use may require B12 supplementation), lactic acidosis risk is extremely low and mainly in those with kidney issues.
Use in non-diabetics: Being trialed in the large TAME study for anti-aging. Many longevity enthusiasts already take it. Some concerns: it may blunt some benefits of intense exercise (due to blunting insulin spikes/mTOR), so timing around workouts might be considered.
5.2 Rapamycin and mTOR Inhibitors
Rapamycin (Sirolimus) is an immunosuppressant drug (used for organ transplant patients) that, at lower doses, has shown life-extension in multiple species by inhibiting mTOR.
Mechanism: Inhibits the mTOR pathway, which is a key regulator of cell growth and protein synthesis. Chronic activation of mTOR is implicated in aging; intermittent inhibition (via rapamycin) may promote autophagy and stress resistance.
Lifespan Evidence: Rapamycin has extended lifespan in mice (even when started late in life). It works in both males and females across strains, and also extends life in flies and worms. It’s considered a gold standard of anti-aging drugs in research.
Use in humans: A growing number of doctors and biohackers experiment with low-dose rapamycin for anti-aging. Common protocols: 5–10 mg once weekly (intermittent dosing aims to get benefits while minimizing side effects). Some use 2–3 mg twice weekly. Continuous daily use is avoided due to immune suppression risk (the idea is to let immune system recover on off days).
Expected benefits: Possibly reduced incidence of age-related diseases (hope it may preserve organ function, reduce cancers, etc., though not yet proven in humans). Short-term studies show improved immune function in elderly on rapalogues (better vaccine responses). Anecdotally, some users report improved skin or sense of well-being, but concrete markers are still being studied.
Side effects: In higher transplant doses, rapamycin can cause mouth ulcers (common), high blood lipids or triglycerides, and impair wound healing if taken during injury (inhibiting cell growth). It can mildly worsen glucose tolerance (paradoxically, while metformin improves metabolic profile, rapamycin can impair it, though intermittent dosing seems okay). There’s infection risk if overdosed (due to immunosuppression). Intermittent low dosing appears relatively safe per some physicians’ reports, but it is prescription-only and off-label for longevity, requiring careful medical supervision.
In practice: Some view rapamycin as an advanced intervention perhaps for those over 50 or at high risk of age-related disease, whereas younger individuals might focus on lifestyle and milder supplements first.
5.3 NAD+ Boosters (NR, NMN, etc.)
NAD+ (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) is a critical coenzyme in cells for metabolism and DNA repair (cofactor for sirtuins and PARP enzymes). NAD+ levels decline with age in many tissues. Boosting NAD+ has shown beneficial effects in animal studies (improved mitochondrial function, extended lifespan in rodents).
Popular supplements:
Nicotinamide Riboside (NR): A form of vitamin B3 that converts to NAD+.
Nicotinamide Mononucleotide (NMN): A more direct NAD+ precursor (one step closer in the pathway).
Research: Human trials show NR or NMN supplementation can increase NAD+ levels in blood and tissue. A recent trial with NMN in middle-aged women showed improved muscle insulin sensitivity and slight endurance improvements. NR trials have shown raised NAD+ but modest functional outcomes so far.
Dose: NR 250–500 mg/day; NMN 250–1,000 mg/day (often split). Often taken in the morning.
Anecdotal benefits: Users report better energy levels, improved recovery, and sharper cognition. Some claim anti-aging effects like better skin or endurance, but these are subjective.
Safety: Short-term trials up to a year haven’t flagged major issues aside from mild flushing or stomach upset. Nicotinamide (plain niacinamide) is cheaper and also raises NAD+, but high doses of plain nicotinamide could inhibit sirtuins (counterproductive), hence interest in NR/NMN.
5.4 Senolytics
Senolytics are compounds that selectively induce death of senescent cells (cells that have stopped dividing and contribute to aging/inflammation). Clearing senescent cells in animals rejuvenates tissues and extends healthy lifespan.
Key senolytics being explored:
Dasatinib + Quercetin (D+Q): Dasatinib is a leukemia drug; Quercetin is a flavonoid. In combination, they cleared senescent cells in mice (especially in fat tissue).
Protocol (experimental): Dasatinib 100 mg + Quercetin 1,000 mg, once weekly or once monthly (a pulsed dosing to clear cells).
Results: In mice, improved cardiovascular function, endurance, and overall healthspan. Human trials (small) showed improved diabetic kidney function and senescence markers.
Risks: Dasatinib can have serious side effects (it’s a chemo drug): bleeding risk, lowered blood counts, etc. This is not a regimen to try lightly.
Fisetin: A flavonoid found in fruits (strawberries) identified as a senolytic in high doses.
Dose (experimental): 20 mg/kg/day for 2–3 days (e.g., for a 70 kg human, ~1.4 g/day, pulsed monthly).
Evidence: Extended life in old mice by ~10%. Readily available supplement, thus some self-experimentation is happening.
Side effects: High doses could cause nausea or mild diarrhea for a day.
Other senolytics: Navitoclax (an experimental cancer drug) is senolytic but with high toxicity. Curcumin and EGCG (from green tea) have mild senolytic hints but weaker. UBX0101 (an experimental senolytic for osteoarthritis) showed promise in clearing senescent cells in joints.
Current state: Senolytics are one of the most hyped areas in longevity research, but human protocols are not established. Some biohackers do “senolytic courses” occasionally (like a 2-day high-dose fisetin each month, or a round of D+Q every few months). Caution is urged—most senolytic compounds are not fully benign.
5.5 Hormone Optimization for Longevity
Maintaining hormone levels in an optimal range is thought to support healthy aging:
Testosterone (for men): Levels decline with age, which can affect muscle mass, bone density, mood, and libido. Some men opt for testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) in older age to restore youthful levels. TRT can improve quality of life and body composition, but it’s a lifelong commitment once started and can have risks (e.g., erythrocytosis, prostate effects).
Growth Hormone: GH also declines with age. While GH therapy can increase muscle and reduce fat, chronic use in older adults might increase risk of diabetes or carpal tunnel issues, and possibly cancer risk. Thus, it’s not widely recommended as an anti-aging therapy in healthy individuals.
Thyroid: Aging can bring slightly lower thyroid function. Ensuring optimal (not hyper) thyroid hormone levels can keep metabolism and energy up. Some use low-dose thyroid (like Armour Thyroid or levothyroxine) if their levels are low-normal and symptomatic.
DHEA: An adrenal hormone that declines with age, precursor to testosterone and estrogen. DHEA supplements (25–50 mg/day) in older adults might improve skin, libido, and energy modestly. Needs monitoring, as it converts to other hormones.
Melatonin: Covered in Sleep section, but its production declines with age. Some consider long-term low-dose melatonin supplementation not only for sleep but potential anti-cancer/antioxidant benefits.
The goal in hormone optimization is to bring levels to the youthful-adult range (e.g., testosterone mid-high normal for a 30-year-old) rather than supraphysiological. This often requires working with an endocrinologist or anti-aging physician.
5.6 Other Potential Longevity Agents
Coenzyme Q10 & Mitochondrial support: CoQ10 (particularly in ubiquinol form, 100–200 mg/day) supports mitochondrial function and is important if one is on a statin. Pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ, ~20 mg/day) is another supplement aimed at mitochondrial biogenesis.
Aspirin (Baby aspirin): Low-dose aspirin (81 mg) is no longer universally recommended, but some longevity protocols include it for its anti-inflammatory and anti-platelet effects that might reduce cardiovascular and cancer risk. Risk: bleeding, so this is individualized.
Anti-inflammatories: Chronic low-grade inflammation (“inflammaging”) contributes to aging. Compounds like curcumin (500–1,000 mg/day with black pepper for absorption) and omega-3s can help. Some are exploring drugs like low-dose salsalate (an NSAID) as an inflammation-reducer without harming gut lining as much as other NSAIDs.
Resveratrol: A polyphenol that activates sirtuins, made famous by red wine. Dose: 200–500 mg/day (often with food). Human data is mixed; likely not a panacea, but ongoing research (it showed benefits in obese patients’ metabolism). Some substitute pterostilbene (a similar compound from blueberries with better bioavailability).
Gut health & probiotics: The gut microbiome appears to influence aging (via inflammation and nutrient metabolism). Probiotic supplementation or fermented foods, along with diets high in fiber (prebiotics), might promote a microbiome profile associated with longevity. Specific strains (like Akkermansia) are being studied for metabolic health.
Exercise mimetics: Research is looking at compounds that mimic exercise benefits. Examples: GW501516 (Cardarine), often wrongly classed as a SARM, activates PPAR-delta and increases endurance in mice. It’s not approved due to cancer risk signals at extremely high doses in animal studies. AICAR is another exercise mimetic (AMPK activator) tested in labs but not practical for human use currently.
Lifestyle remains key: No pill or supplement can replace the profound effects of a healthy diet, regular exercise, quality sleep, and stress management on longevity. The compounds above are best viewed as adjuncts to amplify these foundational practices.
Chapter 6: Fat Loss and Metabolic Enhancers
6.1 Sympathomimetics: Clenbuterol and Ephedrine
Sympathomimetics are compounds that stimulate the sympathetic nervous system, increasing metabolism and fat burning.
Clenbuterol: A long-acting beta-2 agonist (not a steroid) used illegally for fat loss.
Dose: 20 mcg to 120 mcg per day (ramped up gradually).
Effects: Increases metabolic rate, body temperature, and fat breakdown. Users experience significant fat loss, especially when combined with diet and cardio.
Side Effects: Shakiness, increased heart rate, anxiety, sweating, headaches, muscle cramps (due to electrolyte depletion), and potential cardiac hypertrophy with long-term use. Needs to be cycled (often 2 weeks on, 2 weeks off) due to receptor downregulation.
Unique: Has anti-catabolic properties in animals, but not clearly in humans. Often combined with Ketotifen or Benadryl at night on cycle to upregulate receptors and improve tolerance.
Ephedrine (Ephedra/Ma Huang): A shorter-acting stimulant.
Dose: 20–25 mg ephedrine, often taken 2–3 times a day (commonly with 200 mg caffeine; the classic “ECA stack” adds aspirin too).
Effects: Increases thermogenesis and suppresses appetite. Fat loss is moderate but notable, especially in those who’ve hit plateaus. Also provides energy boost.
Side Effects: Similar to Clen: jittery feeling, elevated blood pressure/heart rate, insomnia if taken late, potential arrhythmias in predisposed individuals.
Unique: Ephedrine was the go-to OTC fat burner in the ’90s (until banned in many countries). It’s less potent per dose than Clenbuterol but can be as effective across a day with multiple dosing.
Safety: Both Clen and Ephedrine put strain on the heart. Monitoring blood pressure and not exceeding recommended dosages is critical. They should not be used by individuals with cardiovascular issues.
Synergy with diet: These work best in conjunction with a calorie deficit and high-protein diet. They primarily help to push an already healthy regimen to lose fat faster or overcome plateaus.
(Note: Use of Clenbuterol is illegal for humans in most countries; ephedrine is regulated or banned in many places.)
6.2 Thyroid Hormones (T3/T4)
Thyroid hormones are key regulators of metabolic rate. Some bodybuilders use thyroid meds (like Cytomel, which is T3) to boost metabolism during cutting phases.
T4 (Levothyroxine): The prohormone to T3; relatively weaker for fat loss because conversion can be variable.
T3 (Liothyronine/Cytomel): Active thyroid hormone.
Dose (for fat loss): T3 often 25–75 mcg/day in divided doses. (This is beyond medical use – medically, given for hypothyroid conditions only.)
Effects: Elevates basal metabolic rate, can significantly increase calorie burn and weight loss even without changes in diet (though best with diet/exercise). Users become “warmer” and sometimes experience more hunger.
Side Effects: Muscle catabolism (T3 can cause muscle loss if protein intake/training aren’t sufficient, as it’s catabolic at high doses), heart palpitations, anxiety, sweating, potential long-term suppression of one’s own thyroid production (which usually recovers after cessation, but risk of prolonged hypo if misused).
Unique: Because of muscle-loss risk, athletes often use T3 in moderate doses and combine it with anabolic agents to preserve muscle. It’s effective, but the margin between effective and excessive (where one might feel awful) is thin.
6.3 Uncouplers: DNP
2,4-Dinitrophenol (DNP): An infamously potent fat burner that works by uncoupling oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria, wasting energy as heat.
Dose: Extremely low – 100–400 mg/day. (Lethal dose not far above effective dose.)
Effects: Causes massive increase in metabolic rate (you literally burn calories as heat; can raise metabolic rate 30%+). Fat loss is very rapid.
Side Effects: Extreme heat and sweating (risk of hyperthermia), constant warmth and perspiration even at rest, dehydration, lethargy, yellow vision, potentially fatal overheating or organ failure if dose too high or hydration insufficient.
Unique: It’s essentially a cellular poison – once used in the 1930s for weight loss but banned after deaths occurred. Modern use is underground; bodybuilders who dare use it do so with extreme caution.
Safety: Many consider DNP too dangerous at any dose. There is no antidote for overdose besides supportive cooling measures. Even proper dosing requires strict adherence to hydration and avoiding overheating (no heavy exercise on it, stay cool). It’s the epitome of “risk vs reward” in fat loss.
6.4 Insulin (as a Partitioning Agent)
Insulin is an anabolic hormone that also influences fat storage. While it’s not a fat-loss drug (it’s more used in bulking contexts), some advanced users manipulate insulin or insulin sensitivity for recomposition effects.
Use in fat loss context: Paradoxically, some use very low-dose insulin pre-workout with high nutrients to drive nutrients into muscle (improving fullness while in deficit). Alternatively, others attempt “insulin suppression” strategies (like low-carb diets plus metformin or berberine supplement) to keep insulin low and favor fat burning.
Risks: Insulin misuse can cause hypoglycemia (which can be deadly if severe). It’s only for those extremely well-versed, usually competitive bodybuilders.
Safer approach: Focus on insulin sensitivity – e.g., use supplements like berberine (~500 mg 2–3x/day) or prescription metformin to improve insulin sensitivity so that your body’s own insulin is more effective and lower overall. This can aid fat loss and metabolic health.
Metabolic enhancers: Agents like berberine (often compared to metformin in effect), chromium, and alpha-lipoic acid (ALA) can modestly help glucose management, which indirectly aids fat loss in insulin-resistant individuals. They’re not fat burners per se, but part of a metabolic support stack.
6.5 Fat Loss Supplements and Others
Beyond hardcore drugs, there’s a range of supplements and practices for fat loss:
Thermogenic blends: Over-the-counter fat burners often combine caffeine with green tea extract (EGCG), yohimbine, synephrine (from bitter orange), capsaicin (from chili pepper), etc. These offer mild increases in calorie burn and appetite suppression.
Yohimbine: An alpha-2 antagonist that can help mobilize “stubborn” fat (like lower abs, love handles) when taken fasted before cardio (~0.2 mg/kg body weight). It can cause anxiety or blood pressure spikes in some.
Green Tea Extract (EGCG): Supports metabolism and fat oxidation; mild effect but healthy.
Capsaicin (Cayenne): Slight increase in thermogenesis; also can curb appetite.
Ketogenic diets and ketone supplements: By shifting to a fat-based metabolism, body fat can be utilized more efficiently. Some take exogenous ketones (BHB salts or esters) to aid energy and reduce appetite on a keto diet. They can provide mental energy and slight appetite suppression, but alone they don’t burn fat unless you’re in a caloric deficit.
Intermittent Fasting (IF): While not a “supplement,” the practice of fasting (e.g., 16/8 method) can enhance fat loss by tapping into fat stores during the fasted state and improving insulin sensitivity. It pairs well with compounds like caffeine or yohimbine (as mentioned, which works best fasted).
L-Carnitine: Involved in fatty acid transport into mitochondria. Oral bioavailability is low, but some use high-dose oral or injectable L-carnitine to potentially increase fat utilization, especially if deficient or on a vegan diet.
Hydration and electrolytes: Often overlooked – proper hydration (and using electrolytes especially when using stimulants or sweating a lot) keeps metabolism and energy up. Dehydration can mimic fatigue and stall fat loss progress.
Key Warnings: Many fat burners strain the heart (stimulants, thyroid, uncouplers). Monitoring blood pressure and heart rate is essential. Adequate hydration and electrolytes are crucial (especially on thermogenics like Clen or DNP) to avoid dangerous dehydration or arrhythmia. Gradual titration of doses and not exceeding recommended durations dramatically improve safety. If in doubt, focusing on diet adjustments might be slower but is safer than adding a risky drug.
Also, any underlying condition (e.g., undiagnosed hyperthyroid or heart arrhythmia) could be exacerbated by these compounds, so a medical check-up before use is wise. Rapid fat loss drugs can encourage extreme dieting which may backfire (muscle loss, or rebound weight gain due to hormonal adaptation). A sustainable approach is always recommended unless there’s a specific short-term goal like a contest.
Chapter 7: Health and Organ Support during Enhancement
Using performance enhancement protocols, particularly AAS and other potent drugs, can stress various organs and systems. “Health and Organ Support” refers to strategies and compounds used to mitigate these side effects and maintain overall health while pursuing enhancement goals.
Major areas of concern:
Liver: Hepatotoxicity from oral steroids, high-dose niacin, alcohol, etc.
Cardiovascular: Blood pressure, cholesterol, heart structure/function changes.
Kidneys: Strain from high blood pressure, high protein metabolism byproducts.
Prostate: In men, DHT effects from steroids can enlarge prostate.
Gynecological (Women): Managing virilization or menstrual disruptions from AAS.
Mental health: Mood changes, aggression, or addiction potential.
Others: Skin (acne management), hair (preventing loss), etc.
We’ll discuss organ-supportive drugs and supplements, as well as monitoring practices.
7.1 Liver Support
The liver processes most oral compounds and is stressed by 17α-alkylated steroids (e.g., Dianabol, Winstrol, Anadrol), high-dose niacin, alcohol, etc. Signs of stress include elevated ALT and AST enzymes, indicating liver cell damage or inflammation.
Key liver protectants:
N-Acetyl Cysteine (NAC): Precursor to glutathione, a crucial antioxidant. NAC is known as an antidote for acetaminophen toxicity because it replenishes glutathione in the liver. For general support, 600–1200 mg NAC daily can help keep liver enzymes lower. Many steroid users take NAC during and after cycles. It also supports overall detox pathways.
TUDCA (Tauroursodeoxycholic Acid): A bile acid derivative that helps prevent cholestasis and improve bile flow. Particularly useful when oral steroids or high hormone loads may cause bile duct stress. Typical dose 500 mg/day on-cycle.
Milk Thistle (Silymarin): Herbal remedy aiding liver cell regeneration. Dose ~500 mg/day of silymarin extract. Its evidence is mixed but it’s commonly used.
Liv-52 / Liver Care formulas: Ayurvedic combinations (including capers, chicory, arjuna, etc.) historically used for liver health. They have some protective effects in studies, albeit mild.
Limit toxic exposure: Obvious but crucial – avoid alcohol (or keep very minimal) when on liver-stressing compounds. Also avoid using multiple liver-toxic orals at once or for prolonged periods.
Monitoring via bloodwork is key. If ALT/AST rise to, say, 3x the upper limit, many will cease orals until values normalize. The liver is resilient, but chronic abuse can lead to fibrosis.
7.2 Cardiovascular Support
Anabolics (AAS, HGH, etc.) and stimulants can all negatively impact cardiovascular health:
Blood Pressure: Keep it in check. Strategies include:
ACE inhibitors or ARBs (like Telmisartan): Telmisartan 20–40 mg is popular in bodybuilding for BP control and potential metabolic benefits.
Lifestyle: Cardio exercise, low sodium (or rather, moderate sodium with high potassium diet), and proper hydration.
Supplements: Hawthorn berry, garlic extract, and CoQ10 may support BP.
Cholesterol: AAS often depress HDL and raise LDL.
Omega-3 fatty acids (Fish oil 2–3 g EPA/DHA combined) help.
Red Yeast Rice: Contains natural lovastatin – can help keep LDL down.
Niacin (flush type): Raises HDL (though high doses are liver-stressful).
Many users take citrus bergamot extract (~500 mg 2x/day) to improve lipid profile.
Cardarine (not approved for humans) is sometimes used for its lipid benefits, but its safety issues make it controversial.
Heart Structure: Some AAS users get left ventricle hypertrophy over time. Doing cardio (at least 2–3 sessions of 30 min moderate cardio a week) helps maintain cardiac fitness and mitigate enlargement. Also, not staying on extremely high doses long-term and getting periodic echocardiograms if cycling heavy.
Antioxidants: Chronic enhancement can increase oxidative stress. A diet rich in fruits/veggies or adding supplements like Vitamin C + E, or mixed antioxidant formulas (resveratrol, pomegranate extract) can support vascular health.
Regular bloodwork to check lipids and perhaps calcium score or other imaging for advanced users in long-term heavy use is important to catch issues early.
7.3 Kidney Support
Kidneys can be impacted by high blood pressure (the number one kidney killer), high protein diets (controversial if damaging in healthy kidneys, but dehydration with high protein can precipitate issues), and direct toxin exposure (some drugs, excessive supplements).
Support strategies:
Hydration: The simplest and most effective support. 3–4 liters of water spread through the day ensures flushing of waste and less strain.
Blood Pressure Control: As above – absolutely critical to protect kidneys.
Supplements:
Astragalus: High-dose astragalus root has been used in Asia for kidney health (even in chronic kidney disease patients) to reduce proteinuria and inflammation. Doses in grams (5–10 g) in boiling tea or extract form ~500 mg 3x/day in some protocols.
NAC: By raising glutathione, may also help kidneys against oxidative stress.
Avoid NSAIDs: Minimizing use of over-the-counter painkillers that can harm kidneys, especially when dehydrated.
Routine labs: Checking creatinine, BUN, and especially cystatin C or eGFR periodically to ensure kidneys are filtering well. If numbers start trending poorly, back off on stressors (like high-dose supplements or add kidney-specific interventions).
7.4 Prostate and Hair (Androgenic Issues)
Men using AAS or even high-dose DHEA/testosterone over long periods can face prostate enlargement (BPH) or accelerated hair loss.
Prostate:
Finasteride/Dutasteride: 5-ARI drugs that block conversion of testosterone to DHT. Used to reduce prostate size and hair loss. Finasteride 1 mg/day is common. Downsides: can reduce libido or cause erectile issues in some (by lowering DHT too much).
Saw Palmetto: Herbal DHT blocker. Milder than finasteride, but also milder side effects. Dose ~320 mg/day.
Monitor: Regular check-ups for prostate (DRE exam, PSA blood test) for older users. If PSA rises, halt androgen use and investigate.
Hair:
Finasteride again is the main line of defense for steroid-using individuals who don’t want hair loss.
Topical Minoxidil: Encourages blood flow to scalp and can keep follicles in growth phase. Applied 1–2 times daily.
Ketoconazole shampoo (Nizoral): Antifungal shampoo that has anti-androgen properties locally; used 2–3 times a week can slightly help with scalp DHT.
Wigs/Transplants: Ultimately, if genetic male pattern baldness is strong, some accept fate or plan for restoration procedures down the line.
Trade-off: The measures that protect hair/prostate (reducing DHT) may reduce some of the strength or libido benefits of androgens. Many find a personal compromise.
7.5 Mental Health and HPTA Recovery
Mood changes: High-dose steroid cycles can induce mood swings, aggression (though “roid rage” is often overstated, some do get unusually irritable), anxiety, or depression (especially coming off cycles when hormones crash).
Support: Using ancillaries like hCG during cycle to keep some testicular function can ease the post-cycle low. Having a solid PCT (SERM therapy) will help restore endogenous testosterone faster, improving mood.
Supplements: Serotonin support (5-HTP, St. John’s Wort – with caution and no overlap with other meds), adaptogens (ashwagandha, Rhodiola as mentioned) to help stress.
Therapy: Being self-aware and perhaps talking to a counselor if noticing significant mood issues. Sometimes an outside perspective helps manage aggression or depression.
Addiction potential: Some can develop a psychological dependence on being “on” cycles (feeling invincible on hormones, then feeling down off-cycle and thus wanting to start again prematurely). It’s important to have balance and life outside the enhancement journey.
Post-Cycle Therapy (PCT): Crucial for mental and physical recovery after a steroid cycle:
Typical PCT uses Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulators (SERMs) like Nolvadex (Tamoxifen) and Clomid (Clomiphene) for 4–6 weeks to stimulate the pituitary to restart LH/FSH production.
Example: Nolvadex 40 mg + Clomid 50 mg daily for 2 weeks, then Nolva 20 mg + Clomid 25 mg for 2 more weeks.
While SERMs have their own side effects (emotional lability, vision disturbances in Clomid), they significantly help recover endogenous testosterone, which in turn restores normal mood/libido over time.
hCG (human chorionic gonadotropin) is often used last weeks of cycle or first week post-cycle to “kick-start” testes before SERMs (like 500 IU 3x/week for a few weeks) – but using it long-term post-cycle can hinder recovery if mis-timed (since it’s suppressive to pituitary if used too long).
Record Keeping and Trends: It’s wise for enhanced individuals to keep logs of their bloodwork (pre, during, post cycles), blood pressure readings, etc. This helps identify patterns (e.g., “my cholesterol always tanks on Tren, so I should limit it” or “my liver values jump on oral X, so I’ll use support or avoid”).
Building a regime that keeps health markers in range will pay off in sustained ability to pursue one’s goals without hitting a health crisis that forces an abrupt stop.
Chapter 8: Advanced Supplementation Protocols
As individuals become more experienced with basic cycles and supplementation, they often experiment with advanced protocols to further maximize results or overcome plateaus. “Advanced” implies more complex regimens, either through higher dosages, novel drug combinations, unconventional dosing schedules, or integrating multiple pathways simultaneously (hormonal, peptide, nutritional, etc.).
Advanced protocols should only be considered by those with a solid foundation, understand the risks, and have already seen how their body reacts to simpler interventions.
Some advanced topics:
Blasting and cruising vs cycling (never coming off completely).
High-dose or high-risk compounds usage (and how to manage those risks).
Combining multiple categories of enhancement (AAS + GH + insulin, often called the “holy trinity” in bodybuilding).
Site enhancement (SEO oils, local injections of IGF-1 or steroids).
Periodization approaches (varying compounds through phases: e.g., strength vs hypertrophy phases).
Novel experimental compounds (myostatin inhibitors, gene therapy prospects).
Female specific advanced protocols (adapting advanced ideas to female physiology carefully).
8.1 Blast and Cruise
Traditional cycling involves going on a cycle, then coming completely off and doing PCT to restore natural hormones. An alternative practiced by many advanced users is Blast and Cruise:
Blast: a period of high-dose AAS (a cycle), e.g., 12 weeks of a heavy stack.
Cruise: instead of PCT, transition to a low “TRT-level” dose of testosterone (e.g., 100–200 mg/week) to maintain muscle and sexual function, but low enough to give the body a rest from high doses. Essentially it’s staying on steroids year-round, with just a lower dose in between blasts.
This avoids the hormonal rollercoaster and loss of gains from coming off entirely. It basically commits to being on exogenous testosterone for life (since after long-term suppression, natural test may not fully recover).
Protocol: Common approach is blast for 10–16 weeks, cruise for an equal or slightly longer time (12–20 weeks) to let lipids and organs recover, then blast again. Some competitive bodybuilders cruise only 4–6 weeks (not ideal for health but they want to ramp up again quickly). During cruise, one might do bloodwork to ensure everything normalized.
Risks: Staying on TRT dose long-term carries its own risks (though lower than blasting, it still affects fertility and has minor effects on lipids, etc.). The big risk is you are essentially never giving the HPTA a chance to recover – often leading to permanent shutdown (hence needing TRT permanently). There’s also psychological: it can be mentally easier to justify continuous use and perhaps push blasts more frequently, edging into abuse.
Reward: For serious lifters, blast/cruise allows maintaining nearly all gains from blasts (no PCT dip). Many find quality of life on cruise (with normal-ish hormone levels) is better than off-cycle. It’s essentially akin to being on doctor-prescribed TRT plus occasional “treatments” of higher dose.
Who does this: Typically competitive athletes or those who have essentially decided the permanent use of testosterone is acceptable. Often they’re older (30s+) or already hypogonadal. It’s not generally advised for young men who still might recover and want kids, etc.
8.2 High-Risk Compound Management
Using harsher compounds (like Trenbolone, Anadrol, insulin, DNP, high-dose GH) requires strategies to manage their specific risks:
Trenbolone: As discussed, impacts cardiovascular health and mental state. Management: limit duration (e.g., 6–8 weeks max), use supplements for cholesterol/BP, possibly incorporate a low-dose beta blocker at night if severe nighttime heart rate issues, ensure good sleep (tren can cause insomnia/night sweats; some use low-dose melatonin or 5-HTP).
Anadrol (Oxymetholone): Extremely potent oral for mass but very liver-toxic and can cause appetite loss and estrogenic side effects (even though it doesn’t directly convert to estrogen, it behaves like it). Management: dose 25–100 mg max for 4–6 weeks, watch liver enzymes, have anti-estrogens on hand if gyno symptoms appear.
Insulin: Risk of hypoglycemia. Management: extensive education on carb timing and amounts; always have simple sugars on hand; start very low (e.g., 2–4 IU post-workout) and increment slowly.
DNP: (As covered) absolutely requires temperature monitoring, strict dosing schedule, hydration, and someone aware in case of emergency. Typically only experienced chem-users attempt it, and even then with trepidation.
High-dose GH (10+ IU/day): Risk of insulin resistance, carpal tunnel, organ growth. Some take Metformin alongside to counter blood sugar rise. Monitoring fasting glucose is important. Cycle GH (e.g., 3 months on, 1 month off) to reduce risk.
Stacking multiple high-risk together: This is where health monitoring is paramount. Example: some might run a heavy blast of test+tren+oral+GH+insulin. That hits many systems at once. They might incorporate telmisartan (for BP), NAC/TUDCA (for liver), frequent blood glucose checks (for insulin/GH), nightly rest heart rate checks, etc., essentially operating like a full-time job of self-monitoring.
General principle: The higher the risk, the more proactive one must be with protective measures and the shorter the exposure should be. Advanced users often plan out everything – including worst-case scenarios (like having glucose gel for insulin, or an ice bath plan if overheating on DNP, etc.).
8.3 Site Enhancement Techniques
SEO (Site Enhancement Oil): Injections of oil (often synthol, a mix of MCT oil, lidocaine, alcohol) into muscles to stretch the fascia and create an immediate size effect.
Use: Common in small muscle groups like biceps, triceps, delts, calves. The oil is injected deeply and repeatedly (e.g., 1–3 ml in several heads of a muscle, done over weeks).
Effect: Temporarily (and sometimes chronically if scar tissue forms) enlarges the muscle appearance. Also stretches fascia which some believe allows more muscle growth.
Risks: Infection (injecting non-sterile oil or poor technique), nerve damage from volume or pressure, uneven or unnatural look (the infamous “synthol look” with balloon-like muscles if overdone). Can also cause chronic pain or muscle deformity.
Management: Absolute sterility needed. Many keep volumes small and localized. Massage the area post-injection to distribute oil evenly. Use is more of an art; advanced bodybuilders sometimes use a little to correct symmetry issues.
Localized IGF-1 or PGF2a injections: Some experiment with injecting IGF-1 DES or LR3 into a muscle post-workout to potentially spur localized hypertrophy.
IGF-1 DES (short acting) might be injected immediately after training a muscle (e.g., 50 mcg into biceps).
Anecdotal reports vary whether it truly causes site-specific growth or just systemic.
PGF2a (Prostaglandin F2 alpha) is very intense – causes muscle contraction and pain, as well as systemic side effects like vomiting, but a few have tried micro-injections to force growth.
Blood Flow Restriction (BFR) Training: Not a supplement or drug, but an advanced technique – using cuffs or wraps to partially occlude blood flow during light-weight training sets. This causes a huge pump and metabolic stress, leading to growth similar to heavy training.
Often used for injury rehabilitation or to bring up lagging parts without heavy weights.
It’s advanced in that it requires knowledge of proper tightness (7/10 tightness, not full occlusion) and short rest periods.
Combined with enhancement, it can maximize those enhancements in target muscles.
8.4 Bridging Strategies
Between cycles (if not blasting and cruising), some use “bridges” – a light protocol intended to preserve gains without fully being “on.”
Low-dose orals between cycles: e.g., 10 mg Dianabol each morning (trying to take advantage of the body’s natural test at night and just add a bit anabolic in daytime). This is suppressive though, so it’s essentially just staying on a low dose cycle.
Peptide bridges: After an AAS cycle, one might use GH or secretagogues, plus perhaps a SARM like Ostarine, to maintain muscle while allowing HPTA recovery. This still suppresses but to a lesser degree than staying on testosterone.
Cruise as a bridge: Essentially blast & cruise mentality – using a therapeutic dose of test as a “bridge” until next big blast.
Purpose: People hate losing hard-earned gains. Bridges can help hold strength and size so the next big cycle can start from a higher baseline.
Caution: Bridges, if using any anabolic substance, mean the body isn’t truly recovering. Continuous bridging can lead to never fully restoring natural hormones.
8.5 Advanced Nutrition and Supplement Integration
At advanced stages, diet and supplement timing become very precise:
Intra-workout shakes: combining fast carbs, essential amino acids (EAAs), electrolytes, and maybe a pump ingredient (citrulline) to fuel an intense workout, especially when enhanced and pushing beyond normal limits.
Multiple protein sources: blending whey, casein, egg, etc., to get varied absorption rates – slight marginal gains in amino availability.
High-dose antioxidant bursts vs hormesis: Some advanced athletes avoid antioxidants around training because the stress (oxidation) from training helps signal adaptation. They’ll time antioxidants (like Vitamin C, E, polyphenols) away from workouts, so as not to blunt the body’s own adaptation signals.
Insulin use with nutrition: If using insulin, knowing exactly how many grams of carbs per IU keep them safe (generally ~10 g per 1 IU as a rule of thumb, but individuals vary). They will consume highly structured meals (e.g., 100 g cyclic dextrin, 50 g whey, etc.) immediately with insulin, plus have follow-up slower carbs.
Carb cycling or backloading: More advanced diet strategies like very low carbs on rest days and super high carbs on training days to maximize growth yet stay lean. Or carbohydrate backloading (most carbs at night after training) to leverage insulin sensitivity post-workout and promote GH during the low-carb part of day.
Supplements for specific phases: Perhaps using Beta-alanine, creatine, and betaine during a strength phase to maximize power; switching to higher fish oil and joint supplements (glucosamine, etc.) during a cutting phase when joints under strain with less cushioning from body water.
Advanced users often periodize not just training, but supplements and diet composition to align with their cycle phases or goals.
8.6 Female Advanced Protocols
Women in enhancement have to be incredibly careful to avoid virilization (irreversible masculinizing effects). Advanced protocols for women might include low doses of traditionally “advanced” compounds with tight control:
Low-dose anabolics: e.g., 5–10 mg Anavar per day, or 50–75 mg weekly of Primobolan – even these are considered advanced for women compared to basic beginner doses.
GH use: Women respond well to GH for fat loss and some lean mass; 2–4 IU/day could be an advanced addition.
Peptides/SARMs: Some female fitness competitors experiment with Ostarine (say 5 mg/day) or SARMs in place of steroids, though long-term safety unknown. They might try peptides like Ipamorelin for GH boost without steroid risk.
Clenbuterol/T3 combo: Frequently used for contest prep in women. Advanced would be stacking both (like Clen 80 mcg plus T3 50 mcg) under very controlled conditions to strip fat.
Menstrual manipulation: Some use low-dose testosterone during off-season but then need to manage menstrual cycle irregularities. Others might use birth control pills strategically to control timing of cycle relative to competition (though adding exogenous hormones adds complexity).
Post-cycle for women: Women don’t do PCT like men, as their HPTA is different. But after using anabolics, they might have a few months of amenorrhea (no period) – typically one just waits and lets things normalize. Some use herbal support (Vitex agnus-castus) to help restore hormonal rhythm.
Advanced female protocols essentially try to maximize effect while minimizing time on and dose – because side effect threshold is narrow. Some women at elite levels do take on virilization knowingly (deepening voice, etc., often seen in female bodybuilding at the highest level), but that is a serious and personal trade-off.
In summary, advanced supplementation and drug protocols require a deep understanding of one’s body, extensive research, often medical oversight, and a willingness to accept higher risks. The difference between intermediate and advanced often lies in how comprehensive the approach becomes – pulling in knowledge from pharmacology, nutrition, physiology to create a multi-faceted program aimed at pushing the envelope, while (hopefully) preserving health as much as possible under the circumstances.
Chapter 9: Blood Work and Biomarker Optimization
Regular blood work and health monitoring are critical for anyone engaged in enhancement, to ensure internal health is maintained and to catch any issues early. This chapter discusses what biomarkers to check, how to interpret them, and strategies to optimize them.
9.1 Timing of Blood Work
When to test:
Baseline: Before starting any enhancement protocol (to know your natural levels and have a reference).
On-cycle: Mid-cycle bloods (especially for long cycles) can check liver enzymes, lipids, etc., to adjust if needed.
Post-cycle: A few weeks after PCT to see if natural testosterone has recovered, and other markers (lipids, etc.) have normalized.
Regular schedule: Many enhanced athletes do bloods every 3–4 months if blasting and cruising, or at least pre and post each cycle.
Fasted, morning vs other times: Testosterone is highest in the morning (so fasted morning draw is standard). Some hormones like cortisol also vary by time. Try to be consistent in blood test timing to compare accurately.
Context matters: If you just finished a harsh oral, liver enzymes will be up – you know why. The key is to see them return down after stopping. Plan bloods after clearing compounds if the goal is to assess baseline health (e.g., don’t test lipids at peak tren usage to gauge your normal state, test them after you’ve come off and recovered to see if they’re back to healthy range).
9.2 Interpreting and Optimizing Key Biomarkers
Hormones:
Testosterone: In men, should be high-normal on cycle (if on TRT or a cycle, expect > reference range if enhanced). Off-cycle aim is to regain at least mid-normal levels.
Estradiol: On cycle with aromatizing AAS, E2 might elevate. Manage if symptomatic (high E2 causes gyno, water retention). If using an AI, E2 should ideally stay in mid-normal range; too low E2 is also bad (joint pain, low libido).
LH/FSH: These will be near zero on cycle (suppressed). Post PCT, hopefully back in normal range indicating testicular function returning.
SHBG: Often goes down on cycle (especially with androgens like Winstrol, or insulin use). Low SHBG can drive more free T but also more free estrogen. Nothing directly to “optimize” here aside from noting it may affect free hormone calculations.
Thyroid (TSH, Free T3/T4): If using T3, your TSH will be near zero. Ensure after stopping, it comes back to normal. If not using thyroid meds, but see TSH creeping high (> 2.5 or 3) and T4 low-normal, could indicate slight hypothyroid – might address with iodine, selenium, or if symptomatic, consult for possible low-dose thyroid support.
Lipids:
LDL: Ideally <100 mg/dL. On cycle might be elevated; aim to bring it down off-cycle via diet (low sat fat, high soluble fiber) and possibly supplements (fish oil, bergamot).
HDL: Ideally >40 (men) or >50 (women). Steroids often crush HDL (single digits are not unheard of on heavy cycle). Off-cycle, see if it rebounds. Niacin or cardio and abstaining from orals helps raise it.
Triglycerides: Ideally <150. Some bulking diets high in carbs can raise TGs. Fish oil, cutting simple sugars, and not over-consuming alcohol help lower them.
Liver:
ALT/AST: These enzymes can elevate from muscle damage as well (e.g., heavy training) so not always pure liver signal. If ALT/AST are, say, 3–5x upper limit, and you’re on orals, it’s likely liver stress. Use liver supports and re-test after stopping orals.
GGT: A more specific liver enzyme for certain kinds of stress (like cholestasis). If ALT/AST are up but GGT is normal, could just be training effects. If GGT is high, that’s genuine liver/biliary stress.
Bilirubin: Mildly elevated in some lifters due to Gilbert’s syndrome or hemolysis; watch if it’s high with other liver markers as that could indicate a blockage or more serious issue.
Kidney:
Creatinine: Often slightly above normal in muscular individuals; use with eGFR (which factors age/sex/etc.). If eGFR is mildly reduced but stable, watch trend. If it drops significantly or protein shows in urine, investigate.
BUN: High protein diets elevate BUN. Not as specific to kidney health; look at BUN:Creatinine ratio and hydration status.
Cystatin C: A newer marker less influenced by muscle mass; some get this to gauge kidney function more accurately.
Glucose & Metabolic:
Fasting Glucose: <100 mg/dL ideal. If consistently 100–110+, check fasting insulin or HOMA-IR for insulin resistance. Could be GH use causing slight insulin resistance – consider adjusting diet or adding insulin sensitizers.
HbA1c: Gives average 3-month blood sugar. Should be <5.7%. Enhanced folks using GH or heavy bulks might see it creep up – address via diet (lower carbs or add cardio) or metformin.
Insulin: Fasting insulin low is good (2–10 µIU/mL). High fasting insulin indicates insulin resistance (unless deliberately using insulin which complicates matters).
Cardiac markers:
Blood Pressure: Not a blood test, but track it. Keep <140/90 at absolute max, ideally <130/80. Hypertension management is critical.
Resting Heart Rate: Also trackable without blood test. A fit person should be ~50–70 bpm. AAS (like Tren) can raise it. If RHR is consistently high (>90), that’s strain – take action (more cardio, or beta-blocker if needed).
CRP (C-Reactive Protein): General inflammation marker. If high, could be from hard training or an infection, but chronically high CRP is bad for heart health. Fish oil, diet, even baby aspirin might be utilized if CRP is elevated.
Lipoprotein(a): Genetic risk factor; if an enhanced athlete has high Lp(a), they might be at extra risk, so they’d double down on cardioprotection (niacin can lower Lp(a) some).
Hormone Binding and Others:
IGF-1: If using GH, IGF-1 should be elevated. Monitoring IGF-1 can ensure your GH is legit and dose is effective.
Prolactin: 19-nor steroids (Nandrolone/Tren) can raise prolactin, contributing to sexual sides or gyno. If prolactin is above normal range and user has issues, they might use Cabergoline or Pramipexole carefully to reduce it.
PSA: For older male users or anyone on heavy androgens, checking PSA (prostate marker) yearly. An increase might necessitate a break or evaluation.
General health:
CBC (Complete Blood Count): AAS can increase red blood cell count (polycythemia). Hematocrit above ~52% is concerning – blood donation might be indicated to thin it out. WBC should be normal; if low, could be an immune suppression sign from some drugs.
Electrolytes (Potassium, etc.): Some protocols (like DNP, clen use, or heavy sweating) can alter electrolytes. Usually normal if diet is balanced, but any abnormalities should be corrected to avoid issues like arrhythmias (especially K+).
Kidney values (Uric acid): High protein and muscle breakdown can raise uric acid – ensure not over the threshold (to avoid gout risk).
Ultimately, “optimal” ranges for an enhanced athlete might differ slightly (we accept certain temporarily abnormal values during blasts), but the goal is always to return to normal in health phases. Over time, if repeated cycles are done, one must watch that “normal” returns are indeed happening and not trending worse each year.
9.3 Adjusting Protocol Based on Blood Work
We essentially covered that above – the key is to act on data:
Bring down out-of-range values via medication or discontinuing an offending agent, rather than ignoring them.
Consult healthcare professionals when needed – e.g., if bloodwork shows serious issues (very high liver enzymes, or very low kidney GFR), get proper medical evaluation.
For example:
If ALT is 150 U/L mid-cycle, maybe drop orals 2 weeks earlier and focus on injectables, and follow up in 4 weeks.
If hematocrit is high, donate blood mid-cycle instead of waiting.
If HDL is <10, aggressively incorporate lipid management (intense cardio, supplements, etc.) and plan a longer off-time to let it recover.
If prolactin is high with symptoms, start cabergoline promptly rather than toughing it out.
Conclusion: Blood work is an invaluable tool – akin to doing routine maintenance checks on a high-performance vehicle. By regularly analyzing the internal environment, an individual can fine-tune their regimen to be both maximally effective and minimally harmful. Biomarker optimization is essentially the practice of keeping the body’s internal metrics in ranges that support both current performance and long-term health, adjusting the course whenever something starts to drift off-target.
Chapter 10: Real-World Stacking Protocols and Cycles (Beginner to Advanced)
Overview
Putting together all the compounds, strategies, and safety measures discussed, we can outline example “stacks” or cycles suited for different experience levels and goals. A “stack” refers to the combination of drugs/supplements used concurrently, and a “cycle” includes the time on those compounds (and often PCT after).
We’ll go through:
Beginner cycles (emphasis on lower risk, fewer compounds).
Intermediate cycles (moderate dosages, maybe 2–3 compounds).
Advanced cycles (multiple compounds, higher doses, integration of peptides, etc.).
We will separate based on typical goals: bulking (muscle gain), cutting (fat loss while preserving muscle), and recomp/strength as applicable.
Beginner Cycles
A beginner is someone with no (or very minimal) prior experience with AAS or similar drugs. The goals:
Gain significant muscle/strength beyond natural capacity.
Minimize side effects and avoid complicated protocols (so they can learn how their body reacts).
Avoid compounds that are very harsh or require extensive ancillaries.
Cycle 1: Testosterone-Only (Bulking or Recomp)
Duration: 10–12 weeks.
Testosterone Enanthate or Cypionate at 300–500 mg per week (split into two injections weekly).
An aromatase inhibitor (e.g., Arimidex 0.25–0.5 mg every other day) on hand – only use if symptoms of high estrogen appear (significant bloating, nipple sensitivity). Many beginners on 400–500 mg test will need a low-dose AI.
Optional hCG 250 IU twice weekly during cycle to maintain testicular size (some skip this to keep cycle simpler).
PCT: (if coming off – though many after such a cycle might cruise) Nolvadex 40/40/20/20 mg and Clomid 50/25/25/25 mg, starting 2–3 weeks after last Test E shot.
Expected outcome: With a solid diet and training, a beginner can gain 15–20 lbs (though some is water) on a 500 mg test cycle. Strength increases substantially. Sides might include acne, oily skin, and water retention; gyno is possible if estrogen spikes, but manageable with AI or SERM. This cycle sets a baseline for how one reacts to elevated testosterone.
Cycle 2: Test + Dianabol (Classic Bulk)
Duration: 12 weeks.
Weeks 1–12: Testosterone Enanthate 500 mg/week.
Weeks 1–4: Dianabol 30 mg/day (as a kick-start while waiting for long ester test to build up).
AI: Arimidex 0.5 mg every other day (Dbol and test both aromatize significantly).
Liver support: NAC 600 mg/day during Dbol.
PCT: Nolvadex 40/40/20/20 mg (daily for 4 weeks, tapering), starting 2 weeks after test E last shot.
Notes: This is a classic mass builder. The Dianabol will cause rapid weight and strength gain in the first weeks (a lot is water/glycogen, which adds to strength and joint lubrication). By week 5, testosterone is peaking and the Dbol can be stopped to give the liver a break. Gains can be dramatic (some get 20+ lbs, though much is water/fat if diet isn’t clean). Side effects: considerable water bloat, potential gyno (so AI is key), blood pressure increase, and the need for liver support with Dbol.
The PCT here is crucial as this stack is quite suppressive. A beginner on this might feel like Superman, but must be aware of post-cycle crash without proper PCT.
Cycle 3: Lean Bulk/Recomp – Test + Anavar
Duration: 8 weeks (shorter cycles can be effective with oral inclusion).
Weeks 1–8: Testosterone Propionate 100 mg every other day (approximately 300–350 mg/week).
Weeks 1–8: Anavar 50 mg/day (last 2 weeks, some may up to 75 mg if tolerated).
AI: May not need much since Anavar doesn’t aromatize and test dose is moderate; monitor estradiol by symptoms or bloodwork.
Liver support: advisable due to oral (Anavar is milder but still 17α-alkylated): e.g., NAC 1 g/day.
PCT: Nolvadex 40/40/20/20 or Clomid 50/50/25/25 (start ~3 days after last prop injection, or 2 weeks after last Enanthate if a longer ester was used).
Expected outcome: 5–10 lbs of lean muscle, with possible loss of a little fat (especially if diet is at maintenance or slight deficit – making it a recomp). Strength will go up, vascularity improves (Var gives a hard, dry look). Sides: Very low – Anavar doesn’t convert to estrogen, and it’s DHT-derived, so minimal gyno risk; androgenic sides are mild (Var is low androgenic). Could get slight blood lipid impacts and some HPTA suppression. This is a favorite “first cut” cycle or for someone wanting quality gains without bloating.
General Tips for Beginners: Start with one compound (testosterone) to assess tolerance. Introduce orals or additional injectables in later cycles one at a time. Always do PCT to restore your natural function. Keep cycles moderate length (8–12 weeks) to make recovery easier. Nutrition and training consistency are key; the drugs amplify efforts but can’t replace poor habits.
Intermediate Cycles
After successful simpler cycles, an intermediate might stack 2–3 compounds, use higher doses, and target specific goals (mass vs cut):
Cycle 4: Test / Deca / Dbol – Bulking
Duration: 14 weeks.
Weeks 1–12: Testosterone Enanthate 600 mg/week.
Weeks 1–12: Nandrolone Decanoate (Deca) 400 mg/week.
Weeks 1–4: Dianabol 30 mg/day (optional kick-start).
hCG 250 IU 2×/week (helps recovery later since Deca is very suppressive).
AI: Arimidex 0.5 mg every other day (test + Dbol = plenty of estrogen; Deca also aromatizes slightly).
Possibly Cabergoline 0.25 mg 1×/week (Deca’s prolactin effect at this dose is usually minor, but some take it prophylactically for libido).
PCT: Start ~3 weeks after last Deca shot (long ester): Clomid 50 mg + Nolva 20 mg daily for 2 weeks, then Clomid 25 + Nolva 20 for 2 more weeks.
Expected: This is a proven bulk stack. Gains of 20–30 lbs (with some fat/water) in a cycle are common if diet supports it. Strength skyrockets.
Side effects: High aromatization – likely need AI to prevent gyno and extreme bloat. Deca can cause Deca Dick if test isn’t high enough or prolactin spikes (that’s why test is higher than Deca here and Cabergoline on standby). Blood pressure may go up from water gain. Requires good liver support and monitoring (due to Dbol) and diligent PCT due to heavy HPTA suppression.
Cycle 5: Cutting Stack – Test / Tren / Masteron
Duration: 8–10 weeks (shorter due to Tren’s potency).
Weeks 1–8: Testosterone Propionate 50 mg every other day (~175 mg/week).
Weeks 1–8: Trenbolone Acetate 75 mg every other day (~262 mg/week).
Weeks 1–8: Masteron Propionate 50 mg every other day (~175 mg/week).
Optional oral: Winstrol 30 mg/day Weeks 5–8 for extra hardness (or Anavar 50 mg/day).
AI: Might not be needed – Masteron has anti-estrogenic properties, and Tren doesn’t aromatize; but since test is 175 mg, keep Arimidex 0.25 mg EOD on hand if needed.
Cabergoline: 0.25 mg 2×/week (Tren can elevate prolactin causing sexual sides, so this helps).
PCT: Start 3 days after last injection (short esters). Nolvadex 40/40/20/20 + Clomid 50/50/25/25 (Tren is tough, so using both SERMs for 4–6 weeks).
Expected outcome: Rapid recomposition – users maintain or even gain a bit of muscle while shedding fat quickly. Muscles become extremely hard and vascular. Strength can increase even in caloric deficit (Tren is very powerful).
Sides: Tren’s notorious sides (night sweats, insomnia, irritability, elevated blood pressure); this is an advanced combo due to Tren. Masteron is mostly side-effect free except hair loss in those predisposed (it’s DHT-based). Winstrol adds risk of liver stress and joint dryness. Because all compounds except test are non-aromatizing, estrogen may go low – it’s important not to over-use AI; some even drop AI entirely here and let a slightly higher E2 (from test) help mitigate Tren’s impacts on mood/lipids. PCT after Tren cycles can be tricky – using both Clomid and Nolva and maybe hCG pre-PCT is advisable.
Cycle 6: Lean Bulk with GH and Insulin (Intermediate-Advanced)
Duration: 16 weeks.
Weeks 1–16: Testosterone Enanthate 750 mg/week.
Weeks 1–16: Primobolan 600 mg/week (or Equipoise 600 mg if Primobolan is not available; Primo is chosen for low side effects).
Weeks 1–16: hGH 4 IU/day (2 IU morning, 2 IU before bed or pre-workout).
Weeks 4–15: Insulin (Humulin-R) 5–10 IU post-workout on training days (with adequate carbs/protein).
AI: Arimidex 0.5 mg EOD (Test at 750 aromatizes, but Primo doesn’t; GH can increase conversion of T to E as well).
Metformin 500 mg at night could be used to aid insulin sensitivity given GH+insulin use.
PCT: (if coming off – though many after such a cycle might cruise) Nolvadex 40/40/20/20 mg and Clomid 50/25/25/25 mg, starting 2–3 weeks after last Test E shot.
This cycle combines moderate-high test with a mild anabolic (Primo) plus the powerful synergy of growth hormone and insulin. It’s aimed at an advanced lean bulk:
Expected: Extreme muscle fullness and size with less fat gain than an equivalent steroid-only bulk. GH provides hyperplasia (new muscle cells) and fat loss; insulin shuttles nutrients to muscles for maximal growth (but also can add fat if diet isn’t clean). Over 16 weeks, 15–20 lbs lean gain is possible for an advanced trainer.
Management: Insulin usage demands precise nutrient timing (e.g., 10 g carbs per IU at minimum around the shot, plus overall high-carb diet). Frequent blood glucose monitoring is wise initially. GH can cause water retention and joint pain (typical side effect).
Sides: Aside from those of high test (acne, hair loss potential, blood pressure), GH can cause carpal tunnel-like symptoms or insulin resistance (hence metformin and careful diet). Insulin misuse can be acutely dangerous (hypoglycemia) – one must be experienced or coached for this.
Most intermediate users wouldn’t add GH/insulin until they’ve maximized simpler stacks and need that next-level boost (often competitive bodybuilders). PCT would be standard for the steroid portion, but note if one plans to continue GH, it doesn’t need “PCT” (GH doesn’t suppress HPTA).
Advanced Cycles
Advanced cycles often involve polypharmacy – multiple injectables, an oral kickstart or finisher, GH/insulin, and ancillaries. They are highly customized. Two sample advanced setups:
Cycle 7: Blast Phase of Blast & Cruise (Advanced)
Goal: Maximum mass gain in an offseason blast (not caring about staying lean).
Duration: 12 weeks.
Weeks 1–12: Testosterone Cypionate 1,000 mg/week.
Weeks 1–12: Deca Durabolin 600 mg/week.
Weeks 1–6: Trenbolone Acetate 50 mg every other day (added for recomposition effect even while bulking).
Weeks 7–12: Anadrol 50 mg/day (as a finisher once Tren is dropped to push strength/size).
hGH 6 IU/day throughout (split 3 IU morning, 3 IU post-workout).
Insulin (Humalog fast-acting): 5 IU pre-workout on workout days (with intra-workout carbs/protein drink).
AI: Letrozole 1.25 mg 2×/week (powerful AI for high test/deca).
Cabergoline: 0.5 mg/week (high Deca + some Tren — control prolactin).
During this blast, the user “cruises” afterward on e.g. 200 mg Test.
This is a lot – indeed contest preps get quite pharmacologically heavy to reach extreme leanness.
For the average person, small aids like ECA or prescription phentermine (an older stimulant appetite suppressant) under doctor supervision can be enough to jumpstart fat loss alongside lifestyle changes.
Cycle 8: Contest Prep (Advanced)
16-week prep example:
Weeks 16–9: Test E 500 mg/week + EQ 400 mg/week + Tren E 300 mg/week.
Weeks 8–5: Switch long esters to short – Test Prop 300 mg/week, Tren Ace 400 mg/week, Masteron Prop 400 mg/week.
Weeks 8–1: Add Winstrol 50 mg/day.
Weeks 4–1: Add Halotestin 20 mg/day (for strength and hardness).
Weeks 6–1: T3 50 mcg/day; Clenbuterol (if used) 80 mcg/day in 2-week on/off or continuous with Ketotifen.
Weeks 2–0: Drop Test Prop to 100 mg/week (or zero last week) to reduce water; drop Tren 5 days out (to reduce stress on body pre-show).
Use diuretics last 3 days as needed (common: Aldactone 25 mg/day from 5 days out, then maybe Lasix low dose before stage).
Comprehensive liver, cardio, neuro protection (if possible): e.g., N-Acetylcysteine, taurine (for cramps), etc., during this intense regimen.
This shows how an advanced competitor might stack compounds, tapering and switching to optimize the look on stage (hard, dry, full). It’s extreme and only for those at competition level with experience and ideally coach guidance, because mishandling any of these drugs at this stage (especially diuretics) can be disastrous.
Strength Athlete Advanced (Powerlifting/Pure Strength):
Base cycle: Test suspension 50 mg pre-workout, Tren suspension 50 mg pre-workout (or Halo 20 mg pre-workout) for neural drive and aggression.
Anadrol 100 mg/day for last 4 weeks leading to meet (massive strength gains, but risk water and BP).
HGH 4 IU/day (helps recovery and possibly strength via connective tissue support).
Insulin small dose with huge carb intake can help weight and leverage in powerlifters, but risk fat gain.
They often cycle weight classes – if needing to cut water, might use diuretic briefly but strength suffers. More often they just go up weight classes.
PCT or cruise depending on competitive timeline – many strongman/powerlifters also blast & cruise.
The above strength protocol is very harsh on health – often only done by elite level athletes with oversight. It prioritizes neural strength gains (hence suspensions pre-workout) and brute force weight gain/leverage.
Key Takeaways for Real-World Stacks:
Beginners should start simple; add complexity only as needed when gains plateau.
Every compound has a purpose: e.g., Test as base, Deca for added anabolic bulk, Tren for recomposition, Masteron for hardness, etc. Only include if that purpose aligns with your goal.
More drugs = more side effects management: advanced users need to be diligent with supports (AI, BP meds, etc.) and health checks.
Cycle length and timing matter: long cycles are effective but harder to recover from; advanced often choose to not come off fully.
Never neglect PCT or health restoration phases, unless transitioning to long-term TRT knowingly.
Individualize: Real-world protocols must be adjusted to the individual. For instance, if someone gets debilitating anxiety on Tren, an advanced switch is to use Masteron/Anavar and accept slightly less fat loss. If someone’s liver values skyrocket on 50 mg Dbol, they might use 30 mg or switch to Tbol or Anavar next time.
In conclusion, real-world stacking protocols range from basic to highly complex. The examples given show typical patterns, but real usage should be adapted with caution and ideally under guidance. The most successful enhancement strategies come from balancing efficacy with health and being able to sustain progress over years rather than burning out in one super-cycle. Always keep learning and listening to your body – enhancement is as much an art as a science, and real-world results will follow those who respect both aspects."
